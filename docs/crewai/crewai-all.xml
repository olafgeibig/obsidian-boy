## What is an Agent?
!!! note "What is an Agent?"
    An agent is an **autonomous unit** programmed to:
    <ul>
      <li class='leading-3'>Perform tasks</li>
      <li class='leading-3'>Make decisions</li>
      <li class='leading-3'>Communicate with other agents</li>
    </ul>
    <br/>
    Think of an agent as a member of a team, with specific skills and a particular job to do. Agents can have different roles like 'Researcher', 'Writer', or 'Customer Support', each contributing to the overall goal of the crew.

## Agent Attributes

| Attribute                  | Parameter  | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |

## Creating an Agent

!!! note "Agent Interaction"
    Agents can interact with each other using crewAI's built-in delegation and communication mechanisms. This allows for dynamic task management and problem-solving within the crew.

To create an agent, you would typically initialize an instance of the `Agent` class with the desired properties. Here's a conceptual example including all attributes:

```python
# Example: Creating an agent with all attributes
from crewai import Agent

agent = Agent(
  role='Data Analyst',
  goal='Extract actionable insights',
  backstory="""You're a data analyst at a large company.
  You're responsible for analyzing data and providing insights
  to the business.
  You're currently working on a project to analyze the
  performance of our marketing campaigns.""",
  tools=[my_tool1, my_tool2],  # Optional, defaults to an empty list
  llm=my_llm,  # Optional
  function_calling_llm=my_llm,  # Optional
  max_iter=15,  # Optional
  max_rpm=None, # Optional
  max_execution_time=None, # Optional
  verbose=True,  # Optional
  allow_delegation=False,  # Optional
  step_callback=my_intermediate_step_callback,  # Optional
  cache=True,  # Optional
  system_template=my_system_template,  # Optional
  prompt_template=my_prompt_template,  # Optional
  response_template=my_response_template,  # Optional
  config=my_config,  # Optional
  crew=my_crew,  # Optional
  tools_handler=my_tools_handler,  # Optional
  cache_handler=my_cache_handler,  # Optional
  callbacks=[callback1, callback2],  # Optional
  allow_code_execution=True,  # Optional
  max_retry_limit=2,  # Optional
  use_stop_words=True,  # Optional
  use_system_prompt=True,  # Optional
  respect_context_window=True,  # Optional
)
```

## Setting prompt templates

Prompt templates are used to format the prompt for the agent. You can use to update the system, regular and response templates for the agent. Here's an example of how to set prompt templates:

```python
agent = Agent(
        role="{topic} specialist",
        goal="Figure {goal} out",
        backstory="I am the master of {role}",
        system_template="""<|start_header_id|>system<|end_header_id|>

{{ .System }}<|eot_id|>""",
        prompt_template="""<|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

{{ .Prompt }}<|eot_id|>""",
        response_template="""<|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

{{ .Response }}<|eot_id|>""",
    )
```

## Bring your Third Party Agents
!!! note "Extend your Third Party Agents like LlamaIndex, Langchain, Autogen or fully custom agents using the the crewai's BaseAgent class."

    BaseAgent includes attributes and methods required to integrate with your crews to run and delegate tasks to other agents within your own crew.

    CrewAI is a universal multi-agent framework that allows for all agents to work together to automate tasks and solve problems.


```py
from crewai import Agent, Task, Crew
from custom_agent import CustomAgent # You need to build and extend your own agent logic with the CrewAI BaseAgent class then import it here.

from langchain.agents import load_tools

langchain_tools = load_tools(["google-serper"], llm=llm)

agent1 = CustomAgent(
    role="agent role",
    goal="who is {input}?",
    backstory="agent backstory",
    verbose=True,
)

task1 = Task(
    expected_output="a short biography of {input}",
    description="a short biography of {input}",
    agent=agent1,
)

agent2 = Agent(
    role="agent role",
    goal="summarize the short bio for {input} and if needed do more research",
    backstory="agent backstory",
    verbose=True,
)

task2 = Task(
    description="a tldr summary of the short biography",
    expected_output="5 bullet point summary of the biography",
    agent=agent2,
    context=[task1],
)

my_crew = Crew(agents=[agent1, agent2], tasks=[task1, task2])
crew = my_crew.kickoff(inputs={"input": "Mark Twain"})
```

## Conclusion
Agents are the building blocks of the CrewAI framework. By understanding how to define and interact with agents, you can create sophisticated AI systems that leverage the power of collaborative intelligence.

## Collaboration Fundamentals
!!! note "Core of Agent Interaction"
    Collaboration in CrewAI is fundamental, enabling agents to combine their skills, share information, and assist each other in task execution, embodying a truly cooperative ecosystem.

- **Information Sharing**: Ensures all agents are well-informed and can contribute effectively by sharing data and findings.
- **Task Assistance**: Allows agents to seek help from peers with the required expertise for specific tasks.
- **Resource Allocation**: Optimizes task execution through the efficient distribution and sharing of resources among agents.

## Enhanced Attributes for Improved Collaboration
The `Crew` class has been enriched with several attributes to support advanced functionalities:

- **Language Model Management (`manager_llm`, `function_calling_llm`)**: Manages language models for executing tasks and tools, facilitating sophisticated agent-tool interactions. Note that while `manager_llm` is mandatory for hierarchical processes to ensure proper execution flow, `function_calling_llm` is optional, with a default value provided for streamlined tool interaction.
- **Custom Manager Agent (`manager_agent`)**: Allows specifying a custom agent as the manager instead of using the default manager provided by CrewAI.
- **Process Flow (`process`)**: Defines the execution logic (e.g., sequential, hierarchical) to streamline task distribution and execution.
- **Verbose Logging (`verbose`)**: Offers detailed logging capabilities for monitoring and debugging purposes. It supports both integer and boolean types to indicate the verbosity level. For example, setting `verbose` to 1 might enable basic logging, whereas setting it to True enables more detailed logs.
- **Rate Limiting (`max_rpm`)**: Ensures efficient utilization of resources by limiting requests per minute. Guidelines for setting `max_rpm` should consider the complexity of tasks and the expected load on resources.
- **Internationalization / Customization Support (`language`, `prompt_file`)**: Facilitates full customization of the inner prompts, enhancing global usability. Supported languages and the process for utilizing the `prompt_file` attribute for customization should be clearly documented. [Example of file](https://github.com/joaomdmoura/crewAI/blob/main/src/crewai/translations/en.json)
- **Execution and Output Handling (`full_output`)**: Distinguishes between full and final outputs for nuanced control over task results. Examples showcasing the difference in outputs can aid in understanding the practical implications of this attribute.
- **Callback and Telemetry (`step_callback`, `task_callback`)**: Integrates callbacks for step-wise and task-level execution monitoring, alongside telemetry for performance analytics. The purpose and usage of `task_callback` alongside `step_callback` for granular monitoring should be clearly explained.
- **Crew Sharing (`share_crew`)**: Enables sharing of crew information with CrewAI for continuous improvement and training models. The privacy implications and benefits of this feature, including how it contributes to model improvement, should be outlined.
- **Usage Metrics (`usage_metrics`)**: Stores all metrics for the language model (LLM) usage during all tasks' execution, providing insights into operational efficiency and areas for improvement. Detailed information on accessing and interpreting these metrics for performance analysis should be provided.
- **Memory Usage (`memory`)**: Indicates whether the crew should use memory to store memories of its execution, enhancing task execution and agent learning.
- **Embedder Configuration (`embedder`)**: Specifies the configuration for the embedder to be used by the crew for understanding and generating language. This attribute supports customization of the language model provider.
- **Cache Management (`cache`)**: Determines whether the crew should use a cache to store the results of tool executions, optimizing performance.
- **Output Logging (`output_log_file`)**: Specifies the file path for logging the output of the crew's execution.
- **Planning Mode (`planning`)**: Allows crews to plan their actions before executing tasks by setting `planning=True` when creating the `Crew` instance. This feature enhances coordination and efficiency.
- **Replay Feature**: Introduces a new CLI for listing tasks from the last run and replaying from a specific task, enhancing task management and troubleshooting.

## Delegation: Dividing to Conquer
Delegation enhances functionality by allowing agents to intelligently assign tasks or seek help, thereby amplifying the crew's overall capability.

## Implementing Collaboration and Delegation
Setting up a crew involves defining the roles and capabilities of each agent. CrewAI seamlessly manages their interactions, ensuring efficient collaboration and delegation, with enhanced customization and monitoring features to adapt to various operational needs.

## Example Scenario
Consider a crew with a researcher agent tasked with data gathering and a writer agent responsible for compiling reports. The integration of advanced language model management and process flow attributes allows for more sophisticated interactions, such as the writer delegating complex research tasks to the researcher or querying specific information, thereby facilitating a seamless workflow.

## Conclusion
The integration of advanced attributes and functionalities into the CrewAI framework significantly enriches the agent collaboration ecosystem. These enhancements not only simplify interactions but also offer unprecedented flexibility and control, paving the way for sophisticated AI-driven solutions capable of tackling complex tasks through intelligent collaboration and delegation.

## Introduction

Conditional Tasks in crewAI allow for dynamic workflow adaptation based on the outcomes of previous tasks. This powerful feature enables crews to make decisions and execute tasks selectively, enhancing the flexibility and efficiency of your AI-driven processes.

## Example Usage

```python
from typing import List
from pydantic import BaseModel
from crewai import Agent, Crew
from crewai.tasks.conditional_task import ConditionalTask
from crewai.tasks.task_output import TaskOutput
from crewai.task import Task
from crewai_tools import SerperDevTool

# Define a condition function for the conditional task
# If false, the task will be skipped, if true, then execute the task.
def is_data_missing(output: TaskOutput) -> bool:
    return len(output.pydantic.events) < 10  # this will skip this task

# Define the agents
data_fetcher_agent = Agent(
    role="Data Fetcher",
    goal="Fetch data online using Serper tool",
    backstory="Backstory 1",
    verbose=True,
    tools=[SerperDevTool()]
)

data_processor_agent = Agent(
    role="Data Processor",
    goal="Process fetched data",
    backstory="Backstory 2",
    verbose=True
)

summary_generator_agent = Agent(
    role="Summary Generator",
    goal="Generate summary from fetched data",
    backstory="Backstory 3",
    verbose=True
)

class EventOutput(BaseModel):
    events: List[str]

task1 = Task(
    description="Fetch data about events in San Francisco using Serper tool",
    expected_output="List of 10 things to do in SF this week",
    agent=data_fetcher_agent,
    output_pydantic=EventOutput,
)

conditional_task = ConditionalTask(
    description="""
        Check if data is missing. If we have less than 10 events,
        fetch more events using Serper tool so that
        we have a total of 10 events in SF this week..
        """,
    expected_output="List of 10 Things to do in SF this week",
    condition=is_data_missing,

## Creating and Utilizing Tools in crewAI
This guide provides detailed instructions on creating custom tools for the crewAI framework and how to efficiently manage and utilize these tools, incorporating the latest functionalities such as tool delegation, error handling, and dynamic tool calling. It also highlights the importance of collaboration tools, enabling agents to perform a wide range of actions.

### Prerequisites

Before creating your own tools, ensure you have the crewAI extra tools package installed:

```bash
pip install 'crewai[tools]'
```

### Subclassing `BaseTool`

To create a personalized tool, inherit from `BaseTool` and define the necessary attributes and the `_run` method.

```python
from crewai_tools import BaseTool

class MyCustomTool(BaseTool):
    name: str = "Name of my tool"
    description: str = "What this tool does. It's vital for effective utilization."

    def _run(self, argument: str) -> str:
        # Your tool's logic here
        return "Tool's result"
```

### Using the `tool` Decorator

Alternatively, you can use the tool decorator `@tool`. This approach allows you to define the tool's attributes and functionality directly within a function, offering a concise and efficient way to create specialized tools tailored to your needs.

```python
from crewai_tools import tool

@tool("Tool Name")
def my_simple_tool(question: str) -> str:
    """Tool description for clarity."""
    # Tool logic here
    return "Tool output"
```

### Defining a Cache Function for the Tool

To optimize tool performance with caching, define custom caching strategies using the `cache_function` attribute.

```python
@tool("Tool with Caching")
def cached_tool(argument: str) -> str:
    """Tool functionality description."""
    return "Cacheable result"

def my_cache_strategy(arguments: dict, result: str) -> bool:
    # Define custom caching logic
    return True if some_condition else False

cached_tool.cache_function = my_cache_strategy
```

By adhering to these guidelines and incorporating new functionalities and collaboration tools into your tool creation and management processes, you can leverage the full capabilities of the crewAI framework, enhancing both the development experience and the efficiency of your AI agents.

!!! note "Crew Max RPM"
The `max_rpm` attribute sets the maximum number of requests per minute the crew can perform to avoid rate limits and will override individual agents' `max_rpm` settings if you set it.


## Crew Output

!!! note "Understanding Crew Outputs"
The output of a crew in the crewAI framework is encapsulated within the `CrewOutput` class.
This class provides a structured way to access results of the crew's execution, including various formats such as raw strings, JSON, and Pydantic models.
The `CrewOutput` includes the results from the final task output, token usage, and individual task outputs.

### Crew Output Attributes

| Attribute        | Parameters     | Type                       | Description                                                                                          |
| :--------------- | :------------- | :------------------------- | :--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Raw**          | `raw`          | `str`                      | The raw output of the crew. This is the default format for the output.                               |
| **Pydantic**     | `pydantic`     | `Optional[BaseModel]`      | A Pydantic model object representing the structured output of the crew.                              |
| **JSON Dict**    | `json_dict`    | `Optional[Dict[str, Any]]` | A dictionary representing the JSON output of the crew.                                               |
| **Tasks Output** | `tasks_output` | `List[TaskOutput]`         | A list of `TaskOutput` objects, each representing the output of a task in the crew.                  |
| **Token Usage**  | `token_usage`  | `Dict[str, Any]`           | A summary of token usage, providing insights into the language model's performance during execution. |

### Crew Output Methods and Properties

| Method/Property | Description                                                                                       |
| :-------------- | :------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **json**        | Returns the JSON string representation of the crew output if the output format is JSON.           |
| **to_dict**     | Converts the JSON and Pydantic outputs to a dictionary.                                           |
| \***\*str\*\*** | Returns the string representation of the crew output, prioritizing Pydantic, then JSON, then raw. |

### Accessing Crew Outputs

Once a crew has been executed, its output can be accessed through the `output` attribute of the `Crew` object. The `CrewOutput` class provides various ways to interact with and present this output.

#### Example

```python
# Example crew execution
crew = Crew(
    agents=[research_agent, writer_agent],
    tasks=[research_task, write_article_task],
    verbose=True
)

crew_output = crew.kickoff()

# Accessing the crew output
print(f"Raw Output: {crew_output.raw}")
if crew_output.json_dict:
    print(f"JSON Output: {json.dumps(crew_output.json_dict, indent=2)}")
if crew_output.pydantic:
    print(f"Pydantic Output: {crew_output.pydantic}")
print(f"Tasks Output: {crew_output.tasks_output}")
print(f"Token Usage: {crew_output.token_usage}")
```

## Memory Utilization

Crews can utilize memory (short-term, long-term, and entity memory) to enhance their execution and learning over time. This feature allows crews to store and recall execution memories, aiding in decision-making and task execution strategies.

## Cache Utilization

Caches can be employed to store the results of tools' execution, making the process more efficient by reducing the need to re-execute identical tasks.

## Crew Usage Metrics

After the crew execution, you can access the `usage_metrics` attribute to view the language model (LLM) usage metrics for all tasks executed by the crew. This provides insights into operational efficiency and areas for improvement.

```python
# Access the crew's usage metrics
crew = Crew(agents=[agent1, agent2], tasks=[task1, task2])
crew.kickoff()
print(crew.usage_metrics)
```

## Crew Execution Process

- **Sequential Process**: Tasks are executed one after another, allowing for a linear flow of work.
- **Hierarchical Process**: A manager agent coordinates the crew, delegating tasks and validating outcomes before proceeding. **Note**: A `manager_llm` or `manager_agent` is required for this process and it's essential for validating the process flow.

### Kicking Off a Crew

Once your crew is assembled, initiate the workflow with the `kickoff()` method. This starts the execution process according to the defined process flow.

```python
# Start the crew's task execution
result = my_crew.kickoff()
print(result)
```

### Different Ways to Kick Off a Crew

Once your crew is assembled, initiate the workflow with the appropriate kickoff method. CrewAI provides several methods for better control over the kickoff process: `kickoff()`, `kickoff_for_each()`, `kickoff_async()`, and `kickoff_for_each_async()`.

- `kickoff()`: Starts the execution process according to the defined process flow.
- `kickoff_for_each()`: Executes tasks for each agent individually.
- `kickoff_async()`: Initiates the workflow asynchronously.
- `kickoff_for_each_async()`: Executes tasks for each agent individually in an asynchronous manner.

```python
# Start the crew's task execution
result = my_crew.kickoff()
print(result)

# Example of using kickoff_for_each
inputs_array = [{'topic': 'AI in healthcare'}, {'topic': 'AI in finance'}]
results = my_crew.kickoff_for_each(inputs=inputs_array)
for result in results:
    print(result)

# Example of using kickoff_async
inputs = {'topic': 'AI in healthcare'}
async_result = my_crew.kickoff_async(inputs=inputs)
print(async_result)

# Example of using kickoff_for_each_async
inputs_array = [{'topic': 'AI in healthcare'}, {'topic': 'AI in finance'}]
async_results = my_crew.kickoff_for_each_async(inputs=inputs_array)
for async_result in async_results:
    print(async_result)
```

These methods provide flexibility in how you manage and execute tasks within your crew, allowing for both synchronous and asynchronous workflows tailored to your needs.

### Replaying from a Specific Task

You can now replay from a specific task using our CLI command `replay`.

The replay feature in CrewAI allows you to replay from a specific task using the command-line interface (CLI). By running the command `crewai replay -t <task_id>`, you can specify the `task_id` for the replay process.

Kickoffs will now save the latest kickoffs returned task outputs locally for you to be able to replay from.

### Replaying from a Specific Task Using the CLI

To use the replay feature, follow these steps:

1. Open your terminal or command prompt.
2. Navigate to the directory where your CrewAI project is located.
3. Run the following command:

To view the latest kickoff task IDs, use:

```shell
crewai log-tasks-outputs
```

Then, to replay from a specific task, use:

```shell
crewai replay -t <task_id>
```

These commands let you replay from your latest kickoff tasks, still retaining context from previously executed tasks.

title: Forcing Tool Output as Result
description: Learn how to force tool output as the result in an Agent's task in CrewAI.
---

## Introduction
In CrewAI, you can force the output of a tool as the result of an agent's task. This feature is useful when you want to ensure that the tool output is captured and returned as the task result, avoiding any agent modification during the task execution.

## Forcing Tool Output as Result
To force the tool output as the result of an agent's task, you need to set the `result_as_answer` parameter to `True` when adding a tool to the agent. This parameter ensures that the tool output is captured and returned as the task result, without any modifications by the agent.

Here's an example of how to force the tool output as the result of an agent's task:

```python
# ...
from crewai.agent import Agent
from my_tool import MyCustomTool

# Create a coding agent with the custom tool
coding_agent = Agent(
        role="Data Scientist",
        goal="Produce amazing reports on AI",
        backstory="You work with data and AI",
        tools=[MyCustomTool(result_as_answer=True)],
    )

# Assuming the tool's execution and result population occurs within the system
task_result = coding_agent.execute_task(task)
```

## Workflow in Action

1. **Task Execution**: The agent executes the task using the tool provided.
2. **Tool Output**: The tool generates the output, which is captured as the task result.
3. **Agent Interaction**: The agent may reflect and take learnings from the tool but the output is not modified.
4. **Result Return**: The tool output is returned as the task result without any modifications.

# Human Input in Agent Execution

Human input is critical in several agent execution scenarios, allowing agents to request additional information or clarification when necessary. This feature is especially useful in complex decision-making processes or when agents require more details to complete a task effectively.

## Using Human Input with CrewAI

To integrate human input into agent execution, set the `human_input` flag in the task definition. When enabled, the agent prompts the user for input before delivering its final answer. This input can provide extra context, clarify ambiguities, or validate the agent's output.

### Example:

```shell
pip install crewai
```

```python
import os
from crewai import Agent, Task, Crew
from crewai_tools import SerperDevTool

os.environ["SERPER_API_KEY"] = "Your Key"  # serper.dev API key
os.environ["OPENAI_API_KEY"] = "Your Key"

# Loading Tools
search_tool = SerperDevTool()

# Define your agents with roles, goals, tools, and additional attributes

title: Kickoff Async
description: Kickoff a Crew Asynchronously
---

## Introduction

CrewAI provides the ability to kickoff a crew asynchronously, allowing you to start the crew execution in a non-blocking manner. This feature is particularly useful when you want to run multiple crews concurrently or when you need to perform other tasks while the crew is executing.

## Asynchronous Crew Execution

To kickoff a crew asynchronously, use the `kickoff_async()` method. This method initiates the crew execution in a separate thread, allowing the main thread to continue executing other tasks.

### Method Signature

```python
def kickoff_async(self, inputs: dict) -> CrewOutput:
```

### Parameters

- `inputs` (dict): A dictionary containing the input data required for the tasks.

### Returns

- `CrewOutput`: An object representing the result of the crew execution.

## Potential Use Cases

- **Parallel Content Generation**: Kickoff multiple independent crews asynchronously, each responsible for generating content on different topics. For example, one crew might research and draft an article on AI trends, while another crew generates social media posts about a new product launch. Each crew operates independently, allowing content production to scale efficiently.

- **Concurrent Market Research Tasks**: Launch multiple crews asynchronously to conduct market research in parallel. One crew might analyze industry trends, while another examines competitor strategies, and yet another evaluates consumer sentiment. Each crew independently completes its task, enabling faster and more comprehensive insights.

- **Independent Travel Planning Modules**: Execute separate crews to independently plan different aspects of a trip. One crew might handle flight options, another handles accommodation, and a third plans activities. Each crew works asynchronously, allowing various components of the trip to be planned simultaneously and independently for faster results.

## Example: Single Asynchronous Crew Execution

Here's an example of how to kickoff a crew asynchronously using asyncio and awaiting the result:

```python
import asyncio
from crewai import Crew, Agent, Task

# Create an agent with code execution enabled
coding_agent = Agent(
    role="Python Data Analyst",
    goal="Analyze data and provide insights using Python",
    backstory="You are an experienced data analyst with strong Python skills.",
    allow_code_execution=True
)

# Create a task that requires code execution
data_analysis_task = Task(
    description="Analyze the given dataset and calculate the average age of participants. Ages: {ages}",
    agent=coding_agent
)

# Create a crew and add the task
analysis_crew = Crew(
    agents=[coding_agent],
    tasks=[data_analysis_task]
)

# Async function to kickoff the crew asynchronously
async def async_crew_execution():
    result = await analysis_crew.kickoff_async(inputs={"ages": [25, 30, 35, 40, 45]})
    print("Crew Result:", result)

# Run the async function
asyncio.run(async_crew_execution())
```

## Example: Multiple Asynchronous Crew Executions

In this example, we'll show how to kickoff multiple crews asynchronously and wait for all of them to complete using `asyncio.gather()`:

```python
import asyncio
from crewai import Crew, Agent, Task

# Create an agent with code execution enabled
coding_agent = Agent(
    role="Python Data Analyst",
    goal="Analyze data and provide insights using Python",
    backstory="You are an experienced data analyst with strong Python skills.",
    allow_code_execution=True
)

# Create tasks that require code execution
task_1 = Task(
    description="Analyze the first dataset and calculate the average age of participants. Ages: {ages}",
    agent=coding_agent
)

task_2 = Task(
    description="Analyze the second dataset and calculate the average age of participants. Ages: {ages}",
    agent=coding_agent
)

# Create two crews and add tasks
crew_1 = Crew(agents=[coding_agent], tasks=[task_1])
crew_2 = Crew(agents=[coding_agent], tasks=[task_2])

# Async function to kickoff multiple crews asynchronously and wait for all to finish
async def async_multiple_crews():
    result_1 = crew_1.kickoff_async(inputs={"ages": [25, 30, 35, 40, 45]})
    result_2 = crew_2.kickoff_async(inputs={"ages": [20, 22, 24, 28, 30]})

    # Wait for both crews to finish
    results = await asyncio.gather(result_1, result_2)

    for i, result in enumerate(results, 1):
        print(f"Crew {i} Result:", result)

# Run the async function
asyncio.run(async_multiple_crews())
```

title: Kickoff For Each
description: Kickoff a Crew for a List
---

## Introduction
CrewAI provides the ability to kickoff a crew for each item in a list, allowing you to execute the crew for each item in the list. This feature is particularly useful when you need to perform the same set of tasks for multiple items.

## Kicking Off a Crew for Each Item
To kickoff a crew for each item in a list, use the `kickoff_for_each()` method. This method executes the crew for each item in the list, allowing you to process multiple items efficiently.

Here's an example of how to kickoff a crew for each item in a list:

```python
from crewai import Crew, Agent, Task

# Create an agent with code execution enabled
coding_agent = Agent(
    role="Python Data Analyst",
    goal="Analyze data and provide insights using Python",
    backstory="You are an experienced data analyst with strong Python skills.",
    allow_code_execution=True
)

# Create a task that requires code execution
data_analysis_task = Task(
    description="Analyze the given dataset and calculate the average age of participants. Ages: {ages}",
    agent=coding_agent,
    expected_output="The average age calculated from the dataset"
)

# Create a crew and add the task
analysis_crew = Crew(
    agents=[coding_agent],
    tasks=[data_analysis_task],
    verbose=True,
    memory=False,
    respect_context_window=True  # enable by default
)

datasets = [
  { "ages": [25, 30, 35, 40, 45] },
  { "ages": [20, 25, 30, 35, 40] },
  { "ages": [30, 35, 40, 45, 50] }
]

# Execute the crew
result = analysis_crew.kickoff_for_each(inputs=datasets)

## Introduction to Memory Systems in crewAI

!!! note "Enhancing Agent Intelligence"
    The crewAI framework introduces a sophisticated memory system designed to significantly enhance the capabilities of AI agents. This system comprises short-term memory, long-term memory, entity memory, and contextual memory, each serving a unique purpose in aiding agents to remember, reason, and learn from past interactions.

## Memory System Components

| Component            | Description                                                                                                             |
| :------------------- | :---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Short-Term Memory**| Temporarily stores recent interactions and outcomes using `RAG`, enabling agents to recall and utilize information relevant to their current context during the current executions.|
| **Long-Term Memory** | Preserves valuable insights and learnings from past executions, allowing agents to build and refine their knowledge over time. |
| **Entity Memory**    | Captures and organizes information about entities (people, places, concepts) encountered during tasks, facilitating deeper understanding and relationship mapping. Uses `RAG` for storing entity information. |
| **Contextual Memory**| Maintains the context of interactions by combining `ShortTermMemory`, `LongTermMemory`, and `EntityMemory`, aiding in the coherence and relevance of agent responses over a sequence of tasks or a conversation. |

## How Memory Systems Empower Agents

1. **Contextual Awareness**: With short-term and contextual memory, agents gain the ability to maintain context over a conversation or task sequence, leading to more coherent and relevant responses.

2. **Experience Accumulation**: Long-term memory allows agents to accumulate experiences, learning from past actions to improve future decision-making and problem-solving.

3. **Entity Understanding**: By maintaining entity memory, agents can recognize and remember key entities, enhancing their ability to process and interact with complex information.

## Implementing Memory in Your Crew

When configuring a crew, you can enable and customize each memory component to suit the crew's objectives and the nature of tasks it will perform.
By default, the memory system is disabled, and you can ensure it is active by setting `memory=True` in the crew configuration. The memory will use OpenAI embeddings by default, but you can change it by setting `embedder` to a different model.

The 'embedder' only applies to **Short-Term Memory** which uses Chroma for RAG using the EmbedChain package.
The **Long-Term Memory** uses SQLite3 to store task results. Currently, there is no way to override these storage implementations.
The data storage files are saved into a platform-specific location found using the appdirs package,
and the name of the project can be overridden using the **CREWAI_STORAGE_DIR** environment variable.

### Example: Configuring Memory for a Crew

```python
from crewai import Crew, Agent, Task, Process

# Assemble your crew with memory capabilities
my_crew = Crew(
    agents=[...],

## What is a Pipeline?

A pipeline in crewAI represents a structured workflow that allows for the sequential or parallel execution of multiple crews. It provides a way to organize complex processes involving multiple stages, where the output of one stage can serve as input for subsequent stages.

## Key Terminology

Understanding the following terms is crucial for working effectively with pipelines:

- **Stage**: A distinct part of the pipeline, which can be either sequential (a single crew) or parallel (multiple crews executing concurrently).
- **Kickoff**: A specific execution of the pipeline for a given set of inputs, representing a single instance of processing through the pipeline.
- **Branch**: Parallel executions within a stage (e.g., concurrent crew operations).
- **Trace**: The journey of an individual input through the entire pipeline, capturing the path and transformations it undergoes.

Example pipeline structure:

```
crew1 >> [crew2, crew3] >> crew4
```

This represents a pipeline with three stages:

1. A sequential stage (crew1)
2. A parallel stage with two branches (crew2 and crew3 executing concurrently)
3. Another sequential stage (crew4)

Each input creates its own kickoff, flowing through all stages of the pipeline. Multiple kickoffs can be processed concurrently, each following the defined pipeline structure.

## Pipeline Attributes

| Attribute  | Parameters  | Description                                                                                                        |
| :--------- | :---------- | :----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Stages** | `stages`   | A list of `PipelineStage` (crews, lists of crews, or routers) representing the stages to be executed in sequence. |

## Creating a Pipeline

When creating a pipeline, you define a series of stages, each consisting of either a single crew or a list of crews for parallel execution. The pipeline ensures that each stage is executed in order, with the output of one stage feeding into the next.

### Example: Assembling a Pipeline

```python
from crewai import Crew, Process, Pipeline

# Define your crews
research_crew = Crew(
    agents=[researcher],
    tasks=[research_task],
    process=Process.sequential
)

analysis_crew = Crew(
    agents=[analyst],
    tasks=[analysis_task],
    process=Process.sequential
)

writing_crew = Crew(
    agents=[writer],
    tasks=[writing_task],
    process=Process.sequential
)

# Assemble the pipeline
my_pipeline = Pipeline(
    stages=[research_crew, analysis_crew, writing_crew]
)
```

## Pipeline Methods

| Method           | Description                                                                                                                                                                    |
| :--------------- | :----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **kickoff**      | Executes the pipeline, processing all stages and returning the results. This method initiates one or more kickoffs through the pipeline, handling the flow of data between stages. |
| **process_runs** | Runs the pipeline for each input provided, handling the flow and transformation of data between stages. |

## Pipeline Output

!!! note "Understanding Pipeline Outputs"

| **str**         | Returns the string representation of the run result, prioritizing Pydantic, then JSON, then raw.         |

### Accessing Pipeline Outputs

Once a pipeline has been executed, its output can be accessed through the `PipelineOutput` object returned by the `process_runs` method. The `PipelineOutput` class provides access to individual `PipelineRunResult` objects, each representing a single run through the pipeline.

#### Example

```python
# Define input data for the pipeline
input_data = [{"initial_query": "Latest advancements in AI"}, {"initial_query": "Future of robotics"}]

# Execute the pipeline
pipeline_output = await my_pipeline.process_runs(input_data)

# Access the results
for run_result in pipeline_output.run_results:
    print(f"Run ID: {run_result.id}")
    print(f"Final Raw Output: {run_result.raw}")
    if run_result.json_dict:
        print(f"JSON Output: {json.dumps(run_result.json_dict, indent=2)}")
    if run_result.pydantic:
        print(f"Pydantic Output: {run_result.pydantic}")
    print(f"Token Usage: {run_result.token_usage}")
    print(f"Trace: {run_result.trace}")
    print("Crew Outputs:")
    for crew_output in run_result.crews_outputs:
        print(f"  Crew: {crew_output.raw}")
    print("\n")
```

This example demonstrates how to access and work with the pipeline output, including individual run results and their associated data.

## Using Pipelines

Pipelines are particularly useful for complex workflows that involve multiple stages of processing, analysis, or content generation. They allow you to:

1. **Sequence Operations**: Execute crews in a specific order, ensuring that the output of one crew is available as input to the next.
2. **Parallel Processing**: Run multiple crews concurrently within a stage for increased efficiency.
3. **Manage Complex Workflows**: Break down large tasks into smaller, manageable steps executed by specialized crews.

### Example: Running a Pipeline

```python
# Define input data for the pipeline
input_data = [{"initial_query": "Latest advancements in AI"}]

# Execute the pipeline, initiating a run for each input
results = await my_pipeline.process_runs(input_data)

# Access the results
for result in results:
    print(f"Final Output: {result.raw}")
    print(f"Token Usage: {result.token_usage}")
    print(f"Trace: {result.trace}")  # Shows the path of the input through all stages
```

## Advanced Features

### Parallel Execution within Stages

You can define parallel execution within a stage by providing a list of crews, creating multiple branches:

```python
parallel_analysis_crew = Crew(agents=[financial_analyst], tasks=[financial_analysis_task])
market_analysis_crew = Crew(agents=[market_analyst], tasks=[market_analysis_task])

my_pipeline = Pipeline(
    stages=[
        research_crew,
        [parallel_analysis_crew, market_analysis_crew],  # Parallel execution (branching)
        writing_crew
    ]
)
```

### Routers in Pipelines

Routers are a powerful feature in crewAI pipelines that allow for dynamic decision-making and branching within your workflow. They enable you to direct the flow of execution based on specific conditions or criteria, making your pipelines more flexible and adaptive.

#### What is a Router?

A router in crewAI is a special component that can be included as a stage in your pipeline. It evaluates the input data and determines which path the execution should take next. This allows for conditional branching in your pipeline, where different crews or sub-pipelines can be executed based on the router's decision.

#### Key Components of a Router

1. **Routes**: A dictionary of named routes, each associated with a condition and a pipeline to execute if the condition is met.
2. **Default Route**: A fallback pipeline that is executed if none of the defined route conditions are met.

#### Creating a Router

Here's an example of how to create a router:

```python
from crewai import Router, Route, Pipeline, Crew, Agent, Task

# Define your agents
classifier = Agent(name="Classifier", role="Email Classifier")
urgent_handler = Agent(name="Urgent Handler", role="Urgent Email Processor")
normal_handler = Agent(name="Normal Handler", role="Normal Email Processor")

# Define your tasks
classify_task = Task(description="Classify the email based on its content and metadata.")
urgent_task = Task(description="Process and respond to urgent email quickly.")
normal_task = Task(description="Process and respond to normal email thoroughly.")

# Define your crews
classification_crew = Crew(agents=[classifier], tasks=[classify_task]) # classify email between high and low urgency 1-10
urgent_crew = Crew(agents=[urgent_handler], tasks=[urgent_task])
normal_crew = Crew(agents=[normal_handler], tasks=[normal_task])

# Create pipelines for different urgency levels
urgent_pipeline = Pipeline(stages=[urgent_crew])
normal_pipeline = Pipeline(stages=[normal_crew])

# Create a router
email_router = Router(
    routes={
        "high_urgency": Route(
            condition=lambda x: x.get("urgency_score", 0) > 7,
            pipeline=urgent_pipeline
        ),
        "low_urgency": Route(
            condition=lambda x: x.get("urgency_score", 0) <= 7,
            pipeline=normal_pipeline
        )
    },
    default=Pipeline(stages=[normal_pipeline])  # Default to just normal if no urgency score
)

# Use the router in a main pipeline
main_pipeline = Pipeline(stages=[classification_crew, email_router])

inputs = [{"email": "..."}, {"email": "..."}]  # List of email data

main_pipeline.kickoff(inputs=inputs=inputs)
```

In this example, the router decides between an urgent pipeline and a normal pipeline based on the urgency score of the email. If the urgency score is greater than 7, it routes to the urgent pipeline; otherwise, it uses the normal pipeline. If the input doesn't include an urgency score, it defaults to just the classification crew.

#### Benefits of Using Routers

1. **Dynamic Workflow**: Adapt your pipeline's behavior based on input characteristics or intermediate results.
2. **Efficiency**: Route urgent tasks to quicker processes, reserving more thorough pipelines for less time-sensitive inputs.
3. **Flexibility**: Easily modify or extend your pipeline's logic without changing the core structure.
4. **Scalability**: Handle a wide range of email types and urgency levels with a single pipeline structure.

### Error Handling and Validation

The `Pipeline` class includes validation mechanisms to ensure the robustness of the pipeline structure:

- Validates that stages contain only Crew instances or lists of Crew instances.
- Prevents double nesting of stages to maintain a clear structure.

title: crewAI Planning
description: Learn how to add planning to your crewAI Crew and improve their performance.
---

## Introduction
The planning feature in CrewAI allows you to add planning capability to your crew. When enabled, before each Crew iteration, all Crew information is sent to an AgentPlanner that will plan the tasks step by step, and this plan will be added to each task description.

### Using the Planning Feature
Getting started with the planning feature is very easy, the only step required is to add `planning=True` to your Crew:

```python
from crewai import Crew, Agent, Task, Process

# Assemble your crew with planning capabilities
my_crew = Crew(
    agents=self.agents,
    tasks=self.tasks,
    process=Process.sequential,
    planning=True,
)
```

From this point on, your crew will have planning enabled, and the tasks will be planned before each iteration.

#### Planning LLM

Now you can define the LLM that will be used to plan the tasks. You can use any ChatOpenAI LLM model available.

```python
from crewai import Crew, Agent, Task, Process
from langchain_openai import ChatOpenAI

# Assemble your crew with planning capabilities and custom LLM
my_crew = Crew(
    agents=self.agents,
    tasks=self.tasks,
    process=Process.sequential,
    planning=True,
    planning_llm=ChatOpenAI(model="gpt-4o")
)
```

### Example

When running the base case example, you will see something like the following output, which represents the output of the AgentPlanner responsible for creating the step-by-step logic to add to the Agents' tasks.

title: Managing Processes in CrewAI
description: Detailed guide on workflow management through processes in CrewAI, with updated implementation details.
---

## Understanding Processes
!!! note "Core Concept"
    In CrewAI, processes orchestrate the execution of tasks by agents, akin to project management in human teams. These processes ensure tasks are distributed and executed efficiently, in alignment with a predefined strategy.

## Process Implementations

- **Sequential**: Executes tasks sequentially, ensuring tasks are completed in an orderly progression.
- **Hierarchical**: Organizes tasks in a managerial hierarchy, where tasks are delegated and executed based on a structured chain of command. A manager language model (`manager_llm`) or a custom manager agent (`manager_agent`) must be specified in the crew to enable the hierarchical process, facilitating the creation and management of tasks by the manager.
- **Consensual Process (Planned)**: Aiming for collaborative decision-making among agents on task execution, this process type introduces a democratic approach to task management within CrewAI. It is planned for future development and is not currently implemented in the codebase.

## The Role of Processes in Teamwork
Processes enable individual agents to operate as a cohesive unit, streamlining their efforts to achieve common objectives with efficiency and coherence.

## Assigning Processes to a Crew
To assign a process to a crew, specify the process type upon crew creation to set the execution strategy. For a hierarchical process, ensure to define `manager_llm` or `manager_agent` for the manager agent.

```python
from crewai import Crew
from crewai.process import Process
from langchain_openai import ChatOpenAI

# Example: Creating a crew with a sequential process
crew = Crew(
    agents=my_agents,
    tasks=my_tasks,
    process=Process.sequential
)

# Example: Creating a crew with a hierarchical process
# Ensure to provide a manager_llm or manager_agent
crew = Crew(
    agents=my_agents,
    tasks=my_tasks,
    process=Process.hierarchical,
    manager_llm=ChatOpenAI(model="gpt-4")
    # or
    # manager_agent=my_manager_agent
)
```
**Note:** Ensure `my_agents` and `my_tasks` are defined prior to creating a `Crew` object, and for the hierarchical process, either `manager_llm` or `manager_agent` is also required.

## Sequential Process
This method mirrors dynamic team workflows, progressing through tasks in a thoughtful and systematic manner. Task execution follows the predefined order in the task list, with the output of one task serving as context for the next.

To customize task context, utilize the `context` parameter in the `Task` class to specify outputs that should be used as context for subsequent tasks.

## Hierarchical Process
Emulates a corporate hierarchy, CrewAI allows specifying a custom manager agent or automatically creates one, requiring the specification of a manager language model (`manager_llm`). This agent oversees task execution, including planning, delegation, and validation. Tasks are not pre-assigned; the manager allocates tasks to agents based on their capabilities, reviews outputs, and assesses task completion.

## Process Class: Detailed Overview
The `Process` class is implemented as an enumeration (`Enum`), ensuring type safety and restricting process values to the defined types (`sequential`, `hierarchical`). The consensual process is planned for future inclusion, emphasizing our commitment to continuous development and innovation.

## Conclusion
The structured collaboration facilitated by processes within CrewAI is crucial for enabling systematic teamwork among agents. This documentation has been updated to reflect the latest features, enhancements, and the planned integration of the Consensual Process, ensuring users have access to the most current and comprehensive information.

title: crewAI Tasks
description: Detailed guide on managing and creating tasks within the crewAI framework, reflecting the latest codebase updates.
---

## Overview of a Task

!!! note "What is a Task?"
In the crewAI framework, tasks are specific assignments completed by agents. They provide all necessary details for execution, such as a description, the agent responsible, required tools, and more, facilitating a wide range of action complexities.

Tasks within crewAI can be collaborative, requiring multiple agents to work together. This is managed through the task properties and orchestrated by the Crew's process, enhancing teamwork and efficiency.

## Creating a Task

Creating a task involves defining its scope, responsible agent, and any additional attributes for flexibility:

```python
from crewai import Task

task = Task(
    description='Find and summarize the latest and most relevant news on AI',
    agent=sales_agent,
    expected_output='A bullet list summary of the top 5 most important AI news',
)
```

!!! note "Task Assignment"
Directly specify an `agent` for assignment or let the `hierarchical` CrewAI's process decide based on roles, availability, etc.

## Task Output

!!! note "Understanding Task Outputs"
The output of a task in the crewAI framework is encapsulated within the `TaskOutput` class. This class provides a structured way to access results of a task, including various formats such as raw output, JSON, and Pydantic models.
By default, the `TaskOutput` will only include the `raw` output. A `TaskOutput` will only include the `pydantic` or `json_dict` output if the original `Task` object was configured with `output_pydantic` or `output_json`, respectively.

### Task Output Attributes

| Attribute         | Parameters      | Type                       | Description                                                                                        |
| :---------------- | :-------------- | :------------------------- | :------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Description**   | `description`   | `str`                      | Description of the task.                                                                           |
| **Summary**       | `summary`       | `Optional[str]`            | Summary of the task, auto-generated from the first 10 words of the description.                    |
| **Raw**           | `raw`           | `str`                      | The raw output of the task. This is the default format for the output.                             |
| **Pydantic**      | `pydantic`      | `Optional[BaseModel]`      | A Pydantic model object representing the structured output of the task.                            |
| **JSON Dict**     | `json_dict`     | `Optional[Dict[str, Any]]` | A dictionary representing the JSON output of the task.                                             |

| **Output Format** | `output_format` | `OutputFormat`             | The format of the task output, with options including RAW, JSON, and Pydantic. The default is RAW. |

### Task Methods and Properties

| Method/Property | Description                                                                                       |
| :-------------- | :------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **json**        | Returns the JSON string representation of the task output if the output format is JSON.           |
| **to_dict**     | Converts the JSON and Pydantic outputs to a dictionary.                                           |
| **str**         | Returns the string representation of the task output, prioritizing Pydantic, then JSON, then raw. |

### Accessing Task Outputs

Once a task has been executed, its output can be accessed through the `output` attribute of the `Task` object. The `TaskOutput` class provides various ways to interact with and present this output.

#### Example

```python
# Example task
task = Task(
    description='Find and summarize the latest AI news',
    expected_output='A bullet list summary of the top 5 most important AI news',
    agent=research_agent,
    tools=[search_tool]
)

# Execute the crew
crew = Crew(
    agents=[research_agent],
    tasks=[task],
    verbose=True
)

result = crew.kickoff()

# Accessing the task output
task_output = task.output

print(f"Task Description: {task_output.description}")
print(f"Task Summary: {task_output.summary}")
print(f"Raw Output: {task_output.raw}")
if task_output.json_dict:
    print(f"JSON Output: {json.dumps(task_output.json_dict, indent=2)}")
if task_output.pydantic:
    print(f"Pydantic Output: {task_output.pydantic}")
```

## Integrating Tools with Tasks

Leverage tools from the [crewAI Toolkit](https://github.com/joaomdmoura/crewai-tools) and [LangChain Tools](https://python.langchain.com/docs/integrations/tools) for enhanced task performance and agent interaction.

## Creating a Task with Tools

```python
import os
os.environ["OPENAI_API_KEY"] = "Your Key"
os.environ["SERPER_API_KEY"] = "Your Key" # serper.dev API key

from crewai import Agent, Task, Crew
from crewai_tools import SerperDevTool

research_agent = Agent(
  role='Researcher',
  goal='Find and summarize the latest AI news',
  backstory="""You're a researcher at a large company.
  You're responsible for analyzing data and providing insights
  to the business.""",
  verbose=True
)

# to perform a semantic search for a specified query from a text's content across the internet
search_tool = SerperDevTool()

task = Task(
  description='Find and summarize the latest AI news',
  expected_output='A bullet list summary of the top 5 most important AI news',
  agent=research_agent,
  tools=[search_tool]
)

crew = Crew(
    agents=[research_agent],
    tasks=[task],
    verbose=True
)

result = crew.kickoff()
print(result)
```

This demonstrates how tasks with specific tools can override an agent's default set for tailored task execution.

## Referring to Other Tasks

In crewAI, the output of one task is automatically relayed into the next one, but you can specifically define what tasks' output, including multiple, should be used as context for another task.

This is useful when you have a task that depends on the output of another task that is not performed immediately after it. This is done through the `context` attribute of the task:

```python
# ...

research_ai_task = Task(
    description='Find and summarize the latest AI news',
    expected_output='A bullet list summary of the top 5 most important AI news',
    async_execution=True,
    agent=research_agent,
    tools=[search_tool]
)

research_ops_task = Task(
    description='Find and summarize the latest AI Ops news',
    expected_output='A bullet list summary of the top 5 most important AI Ops news',
    async_execution=True,
    agent=research_agent,
    tools=[search_tool]
)

write_blog_task = Task(
    description="Write a full blog post about the importance of AI and its latest news",
    expected_output='Full blog post that is 4 paragraphs long',
    agent=writer_agent,
    context=[research_ai_task, research_ops_task]
)

#...
```

## Asynchronous Execution

You can define a task to be executed asynchronously. This means that the crew will not wait for it to be completed to continue with the next task. This is useful for tasks that take a long time to be completed, or that are not crucial for the next tasks to be performed.

You can then use the `context` attribute to define in a future task that it should wait for the output of the asynchronous task to be completed.

```python
#...

list_ideas = Task(
    description="List of 5 interesting ideas to explore for an article about AI.",
    expected_output="Bullet point list of 5 ideas for an article.",
    agent=researcher,
    async_execution=True # Will be executed asynchronously
)

list_important_history = Task(
    description="Research the history of AI and give me the 5 most important events.",
    expected_output="Bullet point list of 5 important events.",
    agent=researcher,
    async_execution=True # Will be executed asynchronously
)

write_article = Task(
    description="Write an article about AI, its history, and interesting ideas.",
    expected_output="A 4 paragraph article about AI.",
    agent=writer,
    context=[list_ideas, list_important_history] # Will wait for the output of the two tasks to be completed
)

#...
```

## Callback Mechanism

The callback function is executed after the task is completed, allowing for actions or notifications to be triggered based on the task's outcome.

```python
# ...

def callback_function(output: TaskOutput):
    # Do something after the task is completed
    # Example: Send an email to the manager
    print(f"""
        Task completed!
        Task: {output.description}
        Output: {output.raw}
    """)

research_task = Task(
    description='Find and summarize the latest AI news',
    expected_output='A bullet list summary of the top 5 most important AI news',
    agent=research_agent,
    tools=[search_tool],
    callback=callback_function
)

#...
```

## Accessing a Specific Task Output

Once a crew finishes running, you can access the output of a specific task by using the `output` attribute of the task object:

```python
# ...
task1 = Task(
    description='Find and summarize the latest AI news',
    expected_output='A bullet list summary of the top 5 most important AI news',
    agent=research_agent,
    tools=[search_tool]
)

#...

crew = Crew(
    agents=[research_agent],
    tasks=[task1, task2, task3],
    verbose=True
)

result = crew.kickoff()

# Returns a TaskOutput object with the description and results of the task
print(f"""
    Task completed!
    Task: {task1.output.description}
    Output: {task1.output.raw}
""")
```

## Tool Override Mechanism

Specifying tools in a task allows for dynamic adaptation of agent capabilities, emphasizing CrewAI's flexibility.

## Error Handling and Validation Mechanisms

While creating and executing tasks, certain validation mechanisms are in place to ensure the robustness and reliability of task attributes. These include but are not limited to:

- Ensuring only one output type is set per task to maintain clear output expectations.
- Preventing the manual assignment of the `id` attribute to uphold the integrity of the unique identifier system.

These validations help in maintaining the consistency and reliability of task executions within the crewAI framework.

## Creating Directories when Saving Files

You can now specify if a task should create directories when saving its output to a file. This is particularly useful for organizing outputs and ensuring that file paths are correctly structured.

```python
# ...

save_output_task = Task(
    description='Save the summarized AI news to a file',
    expected_output='File saved successfully',
    agent=research_agent,
    tools=[file_save_tool],
    output_file='outputs/ai_news_summary.txt',
    create_directory=True
)

#...
```

## Conclusion

Tasks are the driving force behind the actions of agents in crewAI. By properly defining tasks and their outcomes, you set the stage for your AI agents to work effectively, either independently or as a collaborative unit. Equipping tasks with appropriate tools, understanding the execution process, and following robust validation practices are crucial for maximizing CrewAI's potential, ensuring agents are effectively prepared for their assignments and that tasks are executed as intended.

## Creating your own Tools

!!! example "Custom Tool Creation"
    Developers can craft custom tools tailored for their agent’s needs or utilize pre-built options:

To create your own crewAI tools you will need to install our extra tools package:

```bash
pip install 'crewai[tools]'
```

Once you do that there are two main ways for one to create a crewAI tool:

### Subclassing `BaseTool`

```python
from crewai_tools import BaseTool

class MyCustomTool(BaseTool):
    name: str = "Name of my tool"
    description: str = "Clear description for what this tool is useful for, your agent will need this information to use it."

    def _run(self, argument: str) -> str:
        # Implementation goes here
        return "Result from custom tool"
```

### Utilizing the `tool` Decorator

```python
from crewai_tools import tool
@tool("Name of my tool")
def my_tool(question: str) -> str:
    """Clear description for what this tool is useful for, your agent will need this information to use it."""
    # Function logic here
    return "Result from your custom tool"
```

### Custom Caching Mechanism
!!! note "Caching"
    Tools can optionally implement a `cache_function` to fine-tune caching behavior. This function determines when to cache results based on specific conditions, offering granular control over caching logic.

```python
from crewai_tools import tool

@tool
def multiplication_tool(first_number: int, second_number: int) -> str:
    """Useful for when you need to multiply two numbers together."""
    return first_number * second_number

def cache_func(args, result):
    # In this case, we only cache the result if it's a multiple of 2
    cache = result % 2 == 0
    return cache

multiplication_tool.cache_function = cache_func

writer1 = Agent(
        role="Writer",
        goal="You write lessons of math for kids.",
        backstory="You're an expert in writing and you love to teach kids but you know nothing of math.",
        tools=[multiplication_tool],
        allow_delegation=False,
    )
    #...
```

## Conclusion
Tools are pivotal in extending the capabilities of CrewAI agents, enabling them to undertake a broad spectrum of tasks and collaborate effectively. When building solutions with CrewAI, leverage both custom and existing tools to empower your agents and enhance the AI ecosystem. Consider utilizing error handling, caching mechanisms, and the flexibility of tool arguments to optimize your agents' performance and capabilities.

## What is an Agent?
!!! note "What is an Agent?"
    An agent is an **autonomous unit** programmed to:
    <ul>
      <li class='leading-3'>Perform tasks</li>
      <li class='leading-3'>Make decisions</li>
      <li class='leading-3'>Communicate with other agents</li>
    </ul>
    <br/>
    Think of an agent as a member of a team, with specific skills and a particular job to do. Agents can have different roles like 'Researcher', 'Writer', or 'Customer Support', each contributing to the overall goal of the crew.

## Creating an Agent

!!! note "Agent Interaction"
    Agents can interact with each other using crewAI's built-in delegation and communication mechanisms. This allows for dynamic task management and problem-solving within the crew.

To create an agent, you would typically initialize an instance of the `Agent` class with the desired properties. Here's a conceptual example including all attributes:

```python
# Example: Creating an agent with all attributes
from crewai import Agent

agent = Agent(
  role='Data Analyst',
  goal='Extract actionable insights',
  backstory="""You're a data analyst at a large company.
  You're responsible for analyzing data and providing insights
  to the business.
  You're currently working on a project to analyze the
  performance of our marketing campaigns.""",
  tools=[my_tool1, my_tool2],  # Optional, defaults to an empty list
  llm=my_llm,  # Optional
  function_calling_llm=my_llm,  # Optional
  max_iter=15,  # Optional
  max_rpm=None, # Optional
  max_execution_time=None, # Optional

## Setting prompt templates

Prompt templates are used to format the prompt for the agent. You can use to update the system, regular and response templates for the agent. Here's an example of how to set prompt templates:

```python
agent = Agent(
        role="{topic} specialist",
        goal="Figure {goal} out",
        backstory="I am the master of {role}",
        system_template="""<|start_header_id|>system<|end_header_id|>

{{ .System }}<|eot_id|>""",
        prompt_template="""<|start_header_id|>user<|end_header_id|>

{{ .Prompt }}<|eot_id|>""",
        response_template="""<|start_header_id|>assistant<|end_header_id|>

{{ .Response }}<|eot_id|>""",
    )
```

## Bring your Third Party Agents
!!! note "Extend your Third Party Agents like LlamaIndex, Langchain, Autogen or fully custom agents using the the crewai's BaseAgent class."

    BaseAgent includes attributes and methods required to integrate with your crews to run and delegate tasks to other agents within your own crew.

    CrewAI is a universal multi-agent framework that allows for all agents to work together to automate tasks and solve problems.


```py
from crewai import Agent, Task, Crew
from custom_agent import CustomAgent # You need to build and extend your own agent logic with the CrewAI BaseAgent class then import it here.

from langchain.agents import load_tools

langchain_tools = load_tools(["google-serper"], llm=llm)

agent1 = CustomAgent(
    role="agent role",
    goal="who is {input}?",
    backstory="agent backstory",
    verbose=True,
)

task1 = Task(
    expected_output="a short biography of {input}",
    description="a short biography of {input}",
    agent=agent1,
)

agent2 = Agent(
    role="agent role",
    goal="summarize the short bio for {input} and if needed do more research",
    backstory="agent backstory",
    verbose=True,
)

task2 = Task(
    description="a tldr summary of the short biography",
    expected_output="5 bullet point summary of the biography",
    agent=agent2,
    context=[task1],
)

my_crew = Crew(agents=[agent1, agent2], tasks=[task1, task2])
crew = my_crew.kickoff(inputs={"input": "Mark Twain"})
```

## Conclusion
Agents are the building blocks of the CrewAI framework. By understanding how to define and interact with agents, you can create sophisticated AI systems that leverage the power of collaborative intelligence.

## Collaboration Fundamentals
!!! note "Core of Agent Interaction"
    Collaboration in CrewAI is fundamental, enabling agents to combine their skills, share information, and assist each other in task execution, embodying a truly cooperative ecosystem.

- **Information Sharing**: Ensures all agents are well-informed and can contribute effectively by sharing data and findings.
- **Task Assistance**: Allows agents to seek help from peers with the required expertise for specific tasks.
- **Resource Allocation**: Optimizes task execution through the efficient distribution and sharing of resources among agents.

## Enhanced Attributes for Improved Collaboration
The `Crew` class has been enriched with several attributes to support advanced functionalities:

- **Language Model Management (`manager_llm`, `function_calling_llm`)**: Manages language models for executing tasks and tools, facilitating sophisticated agent-tool interactions. Note that while `manager_llm` is mandatory for hierarchical processes to ensure proper execution flow, `function_calling_llm` is optional, with a default value provided for streamlined tool interaction.
- **Custom Manager Agent (`manager_agent`)**: Allows specifying a custom agent as the manager instead of using the default manager provided by CrewAI.
- **Process Flow (`process`)**: Defines the execution logic (e.g., sequential, hierarchical) to streamline task distribution and execution.
- **Verbose Logging (`verbose`)**: Offers detailed logging capabilities for monitoring and debugging purposes. It supports both integer and boolean types to indicate the verbosity level. For example, setting `verbose` to 1 might enable basic logging, whereas setting it to True enables more detailed logs.
- **Rate Limiting (`max_rpm`)**: Ensures efficient utilization of resources by limiting requests per minute. Guidelines for setting `max_rpm` should consider the complexity of tasks and the expected load on resources.
- **Internationalization / Customization Support (`language`, `prompt_file`)**: Facilitates full customization of the inner prompts, enhancing global usability. Supported languages and the process for utilizing the `prompt_file` attribute for customization should be clearly documented. [Example of file](https://github.com/joaomdmoura/crewAI/blob/main/src/crewai/translations/en.json)
- **Execution and Output Handling (`full_output`)**: Distinguishes between full and final outputs for nuanced control over task results. Examples showcasing the difference in outputs can aid in understanding the practical implications of this attribute.
- **Callback and Telemetry (`step_callback`, `task_callback`)**: Integrates callbacks for step-wise and task-level execution monitoring, alongside telemetry for performance analytics. The purpose and usage of `task_callback` alongside `step_callback` for granular monitoring should be clearly explained.
- **Crew Sharing (`share_crew`)**: Enables sharing of crew information with CrewAI for continuous improvement and training models. The privacy implications and benefits of this feature, including how it contributes to model improvement, should be outlined.
- **Usage Metrics (`usage_metrics`)**: Stores all metrics for the language model (LLM) usage during all tasks' execution, providing insights into operational efficiency and areas for improvement. Detailed information on accessing and interpreting these metrics for performance analysis should be provided.
- **Memory Usage (`memory`)**: Indicates whether the crew should use memory to store memories of its execution, enhancing task execution and agent learning.
- **Embedder Configuration (`embedder`)**: Specifies the configuration for the embedder to be used by the crew for understanding and generating language. This attribute supports customization of the language model provider.
- **Cache Management (`cache`)**: Determines whether the crew should use a cache to store the results of tool executions, optimizing performance.
- **Output Logging (`output_log_file`)**: Specifies the file path for logging the output of the crew's execution.
- **Planning Mode (`planning`)**: Allows crews to plan their actions before executing tasks by setting `planning=True` when creating the `Crew` instance. This feature enhances coordination and efficiency.
- **Replay Feature**: Introduces a new CLI for listing tasks from the last run and replaying from a specific task, enhancing task management and troubleshooting.

## Delegation: Dividing to Conquer
Delegation enhances functionality by allowing agents to intelligently assign tasks or seek help, thereby amplifying the crew's overall capability.

## Implementing Collaboration and Delegation
Setting up a crew involves defining the roles and capabilities of each agent. CrewAI seamlessly manages their interactions, ensuring efficient collaboration and delegation, with enhanced customization and monitoring features to adapt to various operational needs.

## Example Scenario
Consider a crew with a researcher agent tasked with data gathering and a writer agent responsible for compiling reports. The integration of advanced language model management and process flow attributes allows for more sophisticated interactions, such as the writer delegating complex research tasks to the researcher or querying specific information, thereby facilitating a seamless workflow.

## Conclusion
The integration of advanced attributes and functionalities into the CrewAI framework significantly enriches the agent collaboration ecosystem. These enhancements not only simplify interactions but also offer unprecedented flexibility and control, paving the way for sophisticated AI-driven solutions capable of tackling complex tasks through intelligent collaboration and delegation.

## Introduction

Conditional Tasks in crewAI allow for dynamic workflow adaptation based on the outcomes of previous tasks. This powerful feature enables crews to make decisions and execute tasks selectively, enhancing the flexibility and efficiency of your AI-driven processes.

## Example Usage

```python
from typing import List
from pydantic import BaseModel
from crewai import Agent, Crew
from crewai.tasks.conditional_task import ConditionalTask
from crewai.tasks.task_output import TaskOutput
from crewai.task import Task
from crewai_tools import SerperDevTool

# Define a condition function for the conditional task
# If false, the task will be skipped, if true, then execute the task.
def is_data_missing(output: TaskOutput) -> bool:
    return len(output.pydantic.events) < 10  # this will skip this task

# Define the agents
data_fetcher_agent = Agent(
    role="Data Fetcher",
    goal="Fetch data online using Serper tool",
    backstory="Backstory 1",
    verbose=True,
    tools=[SerperDevTool()]
)

data_processor_agent = Agent(
    role="Data Processor",
    goal="Process fetched data",
    backstory="Backstory 2",
    verbose=True
)

summary_generator_agent = Agent(
    role="Summary Generator",
    goal="Generate summary from fetched data",
    backstory="Backstory 3",
    verbose=True
)

class EventOutput(BaseModel):
    events: List[str]

task1 = Task(
    description="Fetch data about events in San Francisco using Serper tool",
    expected_output="List of 10 things to do in SF this week",
    agent=data_fetcher_agent,
    output_pydantic=EventOutput,
)

conditional_task = ConditionalTask(
    description="""
        Check if data is missing. If we have less than 10 events,
        fetch more events using Serper tool so that
        we have a total of 10 events in SF this week..
        """,
    expected_output="List of 10 Things to do in SF this week",
    condition=is_data_missing,
    agent=data_processor_agent,
)

task3 = Task(
    description="Generate summary of events in San Francisco from fetched data",
    expected_output="A complete report on the customer and their customers and competitors, including their demographics, preferences, market positioning and audience engagement.",
    agent=summary_generator_agent,
)

# Create a crew with the tasks
crew = Crew(
    agents=[data_fetcher_agent, data_processor_agent, summary_generator_agent],
    tasks=[task1, conditional_task, task3],
    verbose=True,
    planning=True
)

# Run the crew
result = crew.kickoff()
print("results", result)

## Creating and Utilizing Tools in crewAI
This guide provides detailed instructions on creating custom tools for the crewAI framework and how to efficiently manage and utilize these tools, incorporating the latest functionalities such as tool delegation, error handling, and dynamic tool calling. It also highlights the importance of collaboration tools, enabling agents to perform a wide range of actions.

### Prerequisites

Before creating your own tools, ensure you have the crewAI extra tools package installed:

```bash
pip install 'crewai[tools]'
```

### Subclassing `BaseTool`

To create a personalized tool, inherit from `BaseTool` and define the necessary attributes and the `_run` method.

```python
from crewai_tools import BaseTool

class MyCustomTool(BaseTool):
    name: str = "Name of my tool"
    description: str = "What this tool does. It's vital for effective utilization."

    def _run(self, argument: str) -> str:
        # Your tool's logic here
        return "Tool's result"
```

### Using the `tool` Decorator

Alternatively, you can use the tool decorator `@tool`. This approach allows you to define the tool's attributes and functionality directly within a function, offering a concise and efficient way to create specialized tools tailored to your needs.

```python
from crewai_tools import tool

@tool("Tool Name")
def my_simple_tool(question: str) -> str:
    """Tool description for clarity."""
    # Tool logic here
    return "Tool output"
```

### Defining a Cache Function for the Tool

To optimize tool performance with caching, define custom caching strategies using the `cache_function` attribute.

```python
@tool("Tool with Caching")
def cached_tool(argument: str) -> str:
    """Tool functionality description."""
    return "Cacheable result"

def my_cache_strategy(arguments: dict, result: str) -> bool:
    # Define custom caching logic
    return True if some_condition else False

cached_tool.cache_function = my_cache_strategy
```

By adhering to these guidelines and incorporating new functionalities and collaboration tools into your tool creation and management processes, you can leverage the full capabilities of the crewAI framework, enhancing both the development experience and the efficiency of your AI agents.

| **Manager Callbacks** _(optional)_    | `manager_callbacks`    | `manager_callbacks` takes a list of callback handlers to be executed by the manager agent when a hierarchical process is used.                                                                                                                            |
| **Prompt File** _(optional)_          | `prompt_file`          | Path to the prompt JSON file to be used for the crew.                                                                                                                                                                                                     |
| **Planning** *(optional)*             | `planning`             | Adds planning ability to the Crew. When activated before each Crew iteration, all Crew data is sent to an AgentPlanner that will plan the tasks and this plan will be added to each task description.                                                     |
| **Planning LLM** *(optional)*         | `planning_llm`         | The language model used by the AgentPlanner in a planning process.                                                                                                                                                                                        |

!!! note "Crew Max RPM"
The `max_rpm` attribute sets the maximum number of requests per minute the crew can perform to avoid rate limits and will override individual agents' `max_rpm` settings if you set it.


## Crew Output

!!! note "Understanding Crew Outputs"
The output of a crew in the crewAI framework is encapsulated within the `CrewOutput` class.
This class provides a structured way to access results of the crew's execution, including various formats such as raw strings, JSON, and Pydantic models.
The `CrewOutput` includes the results from the final task output, token usage, and individual task outputs.

### Crew Output Attributes

| Attribute        | Parameters     | Type                       | Description                                                                                          |
| :--------------- | :------------- | :------------------------- | :--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Raw**          | `raw`          | `str`                      | The raw output of the crew. This is the default format for the output.                               |
| **Pydantic**     | `pydantic`     | `Optional[BaseModel]`      | A Pydantic model object representing the structured output of the crew.                              |
| **JSON Dict**    | `json_dict`    | `Optional[Dict[str, Any]]` | A dictionary representing the JSON output of the crew.                                               |
| **Tasks Output** | `tasks_output` | `List[TaskOutput]`         | A list of `TaskOutput` objects, each representing the output of a task in the crew.                  |
| **Token Usage**  | `token_usage`  | `Dict[str, Any]`           | A summary of token usage, providing insights into the language model's performance during execution. |

### Crew Output Methods and Properties

| Method/Property | Description                                                                                       |
| :-------------- | :------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **json**        | Returns the JSON string representation of the crew output if the output format is JSON.           |
| **to_dict**     | Converts the JSON and Pydantic outputs to a dictionary.                                           |
| \***\*str\*\*** | Returns the string representation of the crew output, prioritizing Pydantic, then JSON, then raw. |

### Accessing Crew Outputs

Once a crew has been executed, its output can be accessed through the `output` attribute of the `Crew` object. The `CrewOutput` class provides various ways to interact with and present this output.

#### Example

```python
# Example crew execution
crew = Crew(
    agents=[research_agent, writer_agent],
    tasks=[research_task, write_article_task],
    verbose=True
)

crew_output = crew.kickoff()

# Accessing the crew output
print(f"Raw Output: {crew_output.raw}")
if crew_output.json_dict:
    print(f"JSON Output: {json.dumps(crew_output.json_dict, indent=2)}")
if crew_output.pydantic:
    print(f"Pydantic Output: {crew_output.pydantic}")
print(f"Tasks Output: {crew_output.tasks_output}")
print(f"Token Usage: {crew_output.token_usage}")
```

## Memory Utilization

Crews can utilize memory (short-term, long-term, and entity memory) to enhance their execution and learning over time. This feature allows crews to store and recall execution memories, aiding in decision-making and task execution strategies.

## Cache Utilization

Caches can be employed to store the results of tools' execution, making the process more efficient by reducing the need to re-execute identical tasks.

## Crew Usage Metrics

After the crew execution, you can access the `usage_metrics` attribute to view the language model (LLM) usage metrics for all tasks executed by the crew. This provides insights into operational efficiency and areas for improvement.

```python
# Access the crew's usage metrics
crew = Crew(agents=[agent1, agent2], tasks=[task1, task2])
crew.kickoff()
print(crew.usage_metrics)
```

## Crew Execution Process

- **Sequential Process**: Tasks are executed one after another, allowing for a linear flow of work.
- **Hierarchical Process**: A manager agent coordinates the crew, delegating tasks and validating outcomes before proceeding. **Note**: A `manager_llm` or `manager_agent` is required for this process and it's essential for validating the process flow.

### Kicking Off a Crew

Once your crew is assembled, initiate the workflow with the `kickoff()` method. This starts the execution process according to the defined process flow.

```python
# Start the crew's task execution
result = my_crew.kickoff()
print(result)
```

### Different Ways to Kick Off a Crew

Once your crew is assembled, initiate the workflow with the appropriate kickoff method. CrewAI provides several methods for better control over the kickoff process: `kickoff()`, `kickoff_for_each()`, `kickoff_async()`, and `kickoff_for_each_async()`.

- `kickoff()`: Starts the execution process according to the defined process flow.
- `kickoff_for_each()`: Executes tasks for each agent individually.
- `kickoff_async()`: Initiates the workflow asynchronously.
- `kickoff_for_each_async()`: Executes tasks for each agent individually in an asynchronous manner.

```python
# Start the crew's task execution
result = my_crew.kickoff()
print(result)

# Example of using kickoff_for_each
inputs_array = [{'topic': 'AI in healthcare'}, {'topic': 'AI in finance'}]
results = my_crew.kickoff_for_each(inputs=inputs_array)
for result in results:
    print(result)

# Example of using kickoff_async
inputs = {'topic': 'AI in healthcare'}
async_result = my_crew.kickoff_async(inputs=inputs)
print(async_result)

# Example of using kickoff_for_each_async
inputs_array = [{'topic': 'AI in healthcare'}, {'topic': 'AI in finance'}]
async_results = my_crew.kickoff_for_each_async(inputs=inputs_array)
for async_result in async_results:
    print(async_result)
```

These methods provide flexibility in how you manage and execute tasks within your crew, allowing for both synchronous and asynchronous workflows tailored to your needs.

### Replaying from a Specific Task

You can now replay from a specific task using our CLI command `replay`.

The replay feature in CrewAI allows you to replay from a specific task using the command-line interface (CLI). By running the command `crewai replay -t <task_id>`, you can specify the `task_id` for the replay process.

Kickoffs will now save the latest kickoffs returned task outputs locally for you to be able to replay from.

### Replaying from a Specific Task Using the CLI

To use the replay feature, follow these steps:

1. Open your terminal or command prompt.
2. Navigate to the directory where your CrewAI project is located.
3. Run the following command:

To view the latest kickoff task IDs, use:

```shell
crewai log-tasks-outputs
```

Then, to replay from a specific task, use:

```shell
crewai replay -t <task_id>
```

These commands let you replay from your latest kickoff tasks, still retaining context from previously executed tasks.

title: Forcing Tool Output as Result
description: Learn how to force tool output as the result in an Agent's task in CrewAI.
---

## Introduction
In CrewAI, you can force the output of a tool as the result of an agent's task. This feature is useful when you want to ensure that the tool output is captured and returned as the task result, avoiding any agent modification during the task execution.

## Forcing Tool Output as Result
To force the tool output as the result of an agent's task, you need to set the `result_as_answer` parameter to `True` when adding a tool to the agent. This parameter ensures that the tool output is captured and returned as the task result, without any modifications by the agent.

Here's an example of how to force the tool output as the result of an agent's task:

```python
# ...
from crewai.agent import Agent
from my_tool import MyCustomTool

# Create a coding agent with the custom tool
coding_agent = Agent(
        role="Data Scientist",
        goal="Produce amazing reports on AI",
        backstory="You work with data and AI",
        tools=[MyCustomTool(result_as_answer=True)],
    )

# Assuming the tool's execution and result population occurs within the system
task_result = coding_agent.execute_task(task)
```

## Workflow in Action

1. **Task Execution**: The agent executes the task using the tool provided.
2. **Tool Output**: The tool generates the output, which is captured as the task result.
3. **Agent Interaction**: The agent may reflect and take learnings from the tool but the output is not modified.
4. **Result Return**: The tool output is returned as the task result without any modifications.

# Human Input in Agent Execution

Human input is critical in several agent execution scenarios, allowing agents to request additional information or clarification when necessary. This feature is especially useful in complex decision-making processes or when agents require more details to complete a task effectively.

## Using Human Input with CrewAI

To integrate human input into agent execution, set the `human_input` flag in the task definition. When enabled, the agent prompts the user for input before delivering its final answer. This input can provide extra context, clarify ambiguities, or validate the agent's output.

### Example:

```shell
pip install crewai
```

```python

title: Kickoff Async
description: Kickoff a Crew Asynchronously
---

## Introduction

CrewAI provides the ability to kickoff a crew asynchronously, allowing you to start the crew execution in a non-blocking manner. This feature is particularly useful when you want to run multiple crews concurrently or when you need to perform other tasks while the crew is executing.

## Asynchronous Crew Execution

To kickoff a crew asynchronously, use the `kickoff_async()` method. This method initiates the crew execution in a separate thread, allowing the main thread to continue executing other tasks.

### Method Signature

```python
def kickoff_async(self, inputs: dict) -> CrewOutput:
```

### Parameters

- `inputs` (dict): A dictionary containing the input data required for the tasks.

### Returns

- `CrewOutput`: An object representing the result of the crew execution.

## Potential Use Cases

- **Parallel Content Generation**: Kickoff multiple independent crews asynchronously, each responsible for generating content on different topics. For example, one crew might research and draft an article on AI trends, while another crew generates social media posts about a new product launch. Each crew operates independently, allowing content production to scale efficiently.

- **Concurrent Market Research Tasks**: Launch multiple crews asynchronously to conduct market research in parallel. One crew might analyze industry trends, while another examines competitor strategies, and yet another evaluates consumer sentiment. Each crew independently completes its task, enabling faster and more comprehensive insights.

- **Independent Travel Planning Modules**: Execute separate crews to independently plan different aspects of a trip. One crew might handle flight options, another handles accommodation, and a third plans activities. Each crew works asynchronously, allowing various components of the trip to be planned simultaneously and independently for faster results.

## Example: Single Asynchronous Crew Execution

Here's an example of how to kickoff a crew asynchronously using asyncio and awaiting the result:

```python
import asyncio
from crewai import Crew, Agent, Task

# Create an agent with code execution enabled
coding_agent = Agent(
    role="Python Data Analyst",
    goal="Analyze data and provide insights using Python",
    backstory="You are an experienced data analyst with strong Python skills.",
    allow_code_execution=True
)

# Create a task that requires code execution
data_analysis_task = Task(
    description="Analyze the given dataset and calculate the average age of participants. Ages: {ages}",
    agent=coding_agent
)

# Create a crew and add the task
analysis_crew = Crew(
    agents=[coding_agent],
    tasks=[data_analysis_task]
)

# Async function to kickoff the crew asynchronously
async def async_crew_execution():
    result = await analysis_crew.kickoff_async(inputs={"ages": [25, 30, 35, 40, 45]})
    print("Crew Result:", result)

# Run the async function
asyncio.run(async_crew_execution())
```

## Example: Multiple Asynchronous Crew Executions

In this example, we'll show how to kickoff multiple crews asynchronously and wait for all of them to complete using `asyncio.gather()`:

```python
import asyncio
from crewai import Crew, Agent, Task

# Create an agent with code execution enabled
coding_agent = Agent(
    role="Python Data Analyst",
    goal="Analyze data and provide insights using Python",
    backstory="You are an experienced data analyst with strong Python skills.",
    allow_code_execution=True
)

# Create tasks that require code execution
task_1 = Task(
    description="Analyze the first dataset and calculate the average age of participants. Ages: {ages}",
    agent=coding_agent
)

task_2 = Task(
    description="Analyze the second dataset and calculate the average age of participants. Ages: {ages}",
    agent=coding_agent
)

# Create two crews and add tasks
crew_1 = Crew(agents=[coding_agent], tasks=[task_1])
crew_2 = Crew(agents=[coding_agent], tasks=[task_2])

# Async function to kickoff multiple crews asynchronously and wait for all to finish
async def async_multiple_crews():
    result_1 = crew_1.kickoff_async(inputs={"ages": [25, 30, 35, 40, 45]})
    result_2 = crew_2.kickoff_async(inputs={"ages": [20, 22, 24, 28, 30]})

    # Wait for both crews to finish
    results = await asyncio.gather(result_1, result_2)

    for i, result in enumerate(results, 1):
        print(f"Crew {i} Result:", result)

# Run the async function
asyncio.run(async_multiple_crews())
```

title: Kickoff For Each
description: Kickoff a Crew for a List
---

## Introduction
CrewAI provides the ability to kickoff a crew for each item in a list, allowing you to execute the crew for each item in the list. This feature is particularly useful when you need to perform the same set of tasks for multiple items.

## Kicking Off a Crew for Each Item
To kickoff a crew for each item in a list, use the `kickoff_for_each()` method. This method executes the crew for each item in the list, allowing you to process multiple items efficiently.

Here's an example of how to kickoff a crew for each item in a list:

```python
from crewai import Crew, Agent, Task

# Create an agent with code execution enabled
coding_agent = Agent(
    role="Python Data Analyst",
    goal="Analyze data and provide insights using Python",
    backstory="You are an experienced data analyst with strong Python skills.",
    allow_code_execution=True
)

# Create a task that requires code execution
data_analysis_task = Task(
    description="Analyze the given dataset and calculate the average age of participants. Ages: {ages}",
    agent=coding_agent,
    expected_output="The average age calculated from the dataset"
)

# Create a crew and add the task
analysis_crew = Crew(
    agents=[coding_agent],
    tasks=[data_analysis_task],
    verbose=True,
    memory=False,
    respect_context_window=True  # enable by default
)

datasets = [
  { "ages": [25, 30, 35, 40, 45] },
  { "ages": [20, 25, 30, 35, 40] },
  { "ages": [30, 35, 40, 45, 50] }
]

# Execute the crew
result = analysis_crew.kickoff_for_each(inputs=datasets)

## Introduction to Memory Systems in crewAI

!!! note "Enhancing Agent Intelligence"
    The crewAI framework introduces a sophisticated memory system designed to significantly enhance the capabilities of AI agents. This system comprises short-term memory, long-term memory, entity memory, and contextual memory, each serving a unique purpose in aiding agents to remember, reason, and learn from past interactions.

## Memory System Components

| Component            | Description                                                                                                             |
| :------------------- | :---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Short-Term Memory**| Temporarily stores recent interactions and outcomes using `RAG`, enabling agents to recall and utilize information relevant to their current context during the current executions.|
| **Long-Term Memory** | Preserves valuable insights and learnings from past executions, allowing agents to build and refine their knowledge over time. |
| **Entity Memory**    | Captures and organizes information about entities (people, places, concepts) encountered during tasks, facilitating deeper understanding and relationship mapping. Uses `RAG` for storing entity information. |
| **Contextual Memory**| Maintains the context of interactions by combining `ShortTermMemory`, `LongTermMemory`, and `EntityMemory`, aiding in the coherence and relevance of agent responses over a sequence of tasks or a conversation. |

## How Memory Systems Empower Agents

1. **Contextual Awareness**: With short-term and contextual memory, agents gain the ability to maintain context over a conversation or task sequence, leading to more coherent and relevant responses.

2. **Experience Accumulation**: Long-term memory allows agents to accumulate experiences, learning from past actions to improve future decision-making and problem-solving.

3. **Entity Understanding**: By maintaining entity memory, agents can recognize and remember key entities, enhancing their ability to process and interact with complex information.

## Implementing Memory in Your Crew

When configuring a crew, you can enable and customize each memory component to suit the crew's objectives and the nature of tasks it will perform.
By default, the memory system is disabled, and you can ensure it is active by setting `memory=True` in the crew configuration. The memory will use OpenAI embeddings by default, but you can change it by setting `embedder` to a different model.

The 'embedder' only applies to **Short-Term Memory** which uses Chroma for RAG using the EmbedChain package.
The **Long-Term Memory** uses SQLite3 to store task results. Currently, there is no way to override these storage implementations.
The data storage files are saved into a platform-specific location found using the appdirs package,
and the name of the project can be overridden using the **CREWAI_STORAGE_DIR** environment variable.

### Example: Configuring Memory for a Crew

```python
from crewai import Crew, Agent, Task, Process

# Assemble your crew with memory capabilities
my_crew = Crew(
    agents=[...],
    tasks=[...],
    process=Process.sequential,
    memory=True,
    verbose=True
)
```

## What is a Pipeline?

A pipeline in crewAI represents a structured workflow that allows for the sequential or parallel execution of multiple crews. It provides a way to organize complex processes involving multiple stages, where the output of one stage can serve as input for subsequent stages.

## Key Terminology

Understanding the following terms is crucial for working effectively with pipelines:

- **Stage**: A distinct part of the pipeline, which can be either sequential (a single crew) or parallel (multiple crews executing concurrently).
- **Kickoff**: A specific execution of the pipeline for a given set of inputs, representing a single instance of processing through the pipeline.
- **Branch**: Parallel executions within a stage (e.g., concurrent crew operations).
- **Trace**: The journey of an individual input through the entire pipeline, capturing the path and transformations it undergoes.

Example pipeline structure:

```
crew1 >> [crew2, crew3] >> crew4
```

This represents a pipeline with three stages:

1. A sequential stage (crew1)
2. A parallel stage with two branches (crew2 and crew3 executing concurrently)
3. Another sequential stage (crew4)

Each input creates its own kickoff, flowing through all stages of the pipeline. Multiple kickoffs can be processed concurrently, each following the defined pipeline structure.

## Pipeline Attributes

| Attribute  | Parameters  | Description                                                                                                        |
| :--------- | :---------- | :----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Stages** | `stages`   | A list of `PipelineStage` (crews, lists of crews, or routers) representing the stages to be executed in sequence. |

## Creating a Pipeline

When creating a pipeline, you define a series of stages, each consisting of either a single crew or a list of crews for parallel execution. The pipeline ensures that each stage is executed in order, with the output of one stage feeding into the next.

### Example: Assembling a Pipeline

```python
from crewai import Crew, Process, Pipeline

# Define your crews
research_crew = Crew(
    agents=[researcher],
    tasks=[research_task],
    process=Process.sequential
)

analysis_crew = Crew(
    agents=[analyst],
    tasks=[analysis_task],
    process=Process.sequential
)

writing_crew = Crew(
    agents=[writer],
    tasks=[writing_task],
    process=Process.sequential
)

# Assemble the pipeline
my_pipeline = Pipeline(
    stages=[research_crew, analysis_crew, writing_crew]
)
```

## Pipeline Methods

| Method           | Description                                                                                                                                                                    |
| :--------------- | :----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **kickoff**      | Executes the pipeline, processing all stages and returning the results. This method initiates one or more kickoffs through the pipeline, handling the flow of data between stages. |
| **process_runs** | Runs the pipeline for each input provided, handling the flow and transformation of data between stages. |

## Pipeline Output

!!! note "Understanding Pipeline Outputs"

| **str**         | Returns the string representation of the run result, prioritizing Pydantic, then JSON, then raw.         |

### Accessing Pipeline Outputs

Once a pipeline has been executed, its output can be accessed through the `PipelineOutput` object returned by the `process_runs` method. The `PipelineOutput` class provides access to individual `PipelineRunResult` objects, each representing a single run through the pipeline.

#### Example

```python
# Define input data for the pipeline
input_data = [{"initial_query": "Latest advancements in AI"}, {"initial_query": "Future of robotics"}]

# Execute the pipeline
pipeline_output = await my_pipeline.process_runs(input_data)

# Access the results
for run_result in pipeline_output.run_results:
    print(f"Run ID: {run_result.id}")
    print(f"Final Raw Output: {run_result.raw}")
    if run_result.json_dict:
        print(f"JSON Output: {json.dumps(run_result.json_dict, indent=2)}")
    if run_result.pydantic:
        print(f"Pydantic Output: {run_result.pydantic}")
    print(f"Token Usage: {run_result.token_usage}")
    print(f"Trace: {run_result.trace}")
    print("Crew Outputs:")
    for crew_output in run_result.crews_outputs:
        print(f"  Crew: {crew_output.raw}")
    print("\n")
```

This example demonstrates how to access and work with the pipeline output, including individual run results and their associated data.

## Using Pipelines

Pipelines are particularly useful for complex workflows that involve multiple stages of processing, analysis, or content generation. They allow you to:

1. **Sequence Operations**: Execute crews in a specific order, ensuring that the output of one crew is available as input to the next.
2. **Parallel Processing**: Run multiple crews concurrently within a stage for increased efficiency.
3. **Manage Complex Workflows**: Break down large tasks into smaller, manageable steps executed by specialized crews.

### Example: Running a Pipeline

```python
# Define input data for the pipeline
input_data = [{"initial_query": "Latest advancements in AI"}]

# Execute the pipeline, initiating a run for each input
results = await my_pipeline.process_runs(input_data)

# Access the results
for result in results:
    print(f"Final Output: {result.raw}")
    print(f"Token Usage: {result.token_usage}")
    print(f"Trace: {result.trace}")  # Shows the path of the input through all stages
```

## Advanced Features

### Parallel Execution within Stages

You can define parallel execution within a stage by providing a list of crews, creating multiple branches:

```python
parallel_analysis_crew = Crew(agents=[financial_analyst], tasks=[financial_analysis_task])
market_analysis_crew = Crew(agents=[market_analyst], tasks=[market_analysis_task])

my_pipeline = Pipeline(
    stages=[
        research_crew,
        [parallel_analysis_crew, market_analysis_crew],  # Parallel execution (branching)
        writing_crew
    ]
)
```

### Routers in Pipelines

Routers are a powerful feature in crewAI pipelines that allow for dynamic decision-making and branching within your workflow. They enable you to direct the flow of execution based on specific conditions or criteria, making your pipelines more flexible and adaptive.

#### What is a Router?

A router in crewAI is a special component that can be included as a stage in your pipeline. It evaluates the input data and determines which path the execution should take next. This allows for conditional branching in your pipeline, where different crews or sub-pipelines can be executed based on the router's decision.

#### Key Components of a Router

1. **Routes**: A dictionary of named routes, each associated with a condition and a pipeline to execute if the condition is met.
2. **Default Route**: A fallback pipeline that is executed if none of the defined route conditions are met.

#### Creating a Router

Here's an example of how to create a router:

```python
from crewai import Router, Route, Pipeline, Crew, Agent, Task

# Define your agents
classifier = Agent(name="Classifier", role="Email Classifier")
urgent_handler = Agent(name="Urgent Handler", role="Urgent Email Processor")
normal_handler = Agent(name="Normal Handler", role="Normal Email Processor")

# Define your tasks
classify_task = Task(description="Classify the email based on its content and metadata.")
urgent_task = Task(description="Process and respond to urgent email quickly.")
normal_task = Task(description="Process and respond to normal email thoroughly.")

# Define your crews
classification_crew = Crew(agents=[classifier], tasks=[classify_task]) # classify email between high and low urgency 1-10
urgent_crew = Crew(agents=[urgent_handler], tasks=[urgent_task])
normal_crew = Crew(agents=[normal_handler], tasks=[normal_task])

# Create pipelines for different urgency levels
urgent_pipeline = Pipeline(stages=[urgent_crew])
normal_pipeline = Pipeline(stages=[normal_crew])

# Create a router
email_router = Router(
    routes={
        "high_urgency": Route(
            condition=lambda x: x.get("urgency_score", 0) > 7,
            pipeline=urgent_pipeline
        ),
        "low_urgency": Route(
            condition=lambda x: x.get("urgency_score", 0) <= 7,
            pipeline=normal_pipeline
        )
    },
    default=Pipeline(stages=[normal_pipeline])  # Default to just normal if no urgency score
)

# Use the router in a main pipeline
main_pipeline = Pipeline(stages=[classification_crew, email_router])

inputs = [{"email": "..."}, {"email": "..."}]  # List of email data

main_pipeline.kickoff(inputs=inputs=inputs)
```

In this example, the router decides between an urgent pipeline and a normal pipeline based on the urgency score of the email. If the urgency score is greater than 7, it routes to the urgent pipeline; otherwise, it uses the normal pipeline. If the input doesn't include an urgency score, it defaults to just the classification crew.

#### Benefits of Using Routers

1. **Dynamic Workflow**: Adapt your pipeline's behavior based on input characteristics or intermediate results.
2. **Efficiency**: Route urgent tasks to quicker processes, reserving more thorough pipelines for less time-sensitive inputs.
3. **Flexibility**: Easily modify or extend your pipeline's logic without changing the core structure.
4. **Scalability**: Handle a wide range of email types and urgency levels with a single pipeline structure.

### Error Handling and Validation

The `Pipeline` class includes validation mechanisms to ensure the robustness of the pipeline structure:

- Validates that stages contain only Crew instances or lists of Crew instances.
- Prevents double nesting of stages to maintain a clear structure.

title: crewAI Planning
description: Learn how to add planning to your crewAI Crew and improve their performance.
---

## Introduction
The planning feature in CrewAI allows you to add planning capability to your crew. When enabled, before each Crew iteration, all Crew information is sent to an AgentPlanner that will plan the tasks step by step, and this plan will be added to each task description.

### Using the Planning Feature
Getting started with the planning feature is very easy, the only step required is to add `planning=True` to your Crew:

```python
from crewai import Crew, Agent, Task, Process

# Assemble your crew with planning capabilities
my_crew = Crew(
    agents=self.agents,
    tasks=self.tasks,
    process=Process.sequential,
    planning=True,
)
```

From this point on, your crew will have planning enabled, and the tasks will be planned before each iteration.

#### Planning LLM

Now you can define the LLM that will be used to plan the tasks. You can use any ChatOpenAI LLM model available.

```python
from crewai import Crew, Agent, Task, Process
from langchain_openai import ChatOpenAI

# Assemble your crew with planning capabilities and custom LLM
my_crew = Crew(
    agents=self.agents,
    tasks=self.tasks,
    process=Process.sequential,
    planning=True,
    planning_llm=ChatOpenAI(model="gpt-4o")
)
```

### Example

When running the base case example, you will see something like the following output, which represents the output of the AgentPlanner responsible for creating the step-by-step logic to add to the Agents' tasks.

title: Managing Processes in CrewAI
description: Detailed guide on workflow management through processes in CrewAI, with updated implementation details.
---

## Understanding Processes
!!! note "Core Concept"
    In CrewAI, processes orchestrate the execution of tasks by agents, akin to project management in human teams. These processes ensure tasks are distributed and executed efficiently, in alignment with a predefined strategy.

## Process Implementations

- **Sequential**: Executes tasks sequentially, ensuring tasks are completed in an orderly progression.
- **Hierarchical**: Organizes tasks in a managerial hierarchy, where tasks are delegated and executed based on a structured chain of command. A manager language model (`manager_llm`) or a custom manager agent (`manager_agent`) must be specified in the crew to enable the hierarchical process, facilitating the creation and management of tasks by the manager.
- **Consensual Process (Planned)**: Aiming for collaborative decision-making among agents on task execution, this process type introduces a democratic approach to task management within CrewAI. It is planned for future development and is not currently implemented in the codebase.

## The Role of Processes in Teamwork
Processes enable individual agents to operate as a cohesive unit, streamlining their efforts to achieve common objectives with efficiency and coherence.

## Assigning Processes to a Crew
To assign a process to a crew, specify the process type upon crew creation to set the execution strategy. For a hierarchical process, ensure to define `manager_llm` or `manager_agent` for the manager agent.

```python
from crewai import Crew
from crewai.process import Process
from langchain_openai import ChatOpenAI

# Example: Creating a crew with a sequential process
crew = Crew(
    agents=my_agents,
    tasks=my_tasks,
    process=Process.sequential
)

# Example: Creating a crew with a hierarchical process
# Ensure to provide a manager_llm or manager_agent
crew = Crew(
    agents=my_agents,
    tasks=my_tasks,
    process=Process.hierarchical,
    manager_llm=ChatOpenAI(model="gpt-4")
    # or
    # manager_agent=my_manager_agent
)
```
**Note:** Ensure `my_agents` and `my_tasks` are defined prior to creating a `Crew` object, and for the hierarchical process, either `manager_llm` or `manager_agent` is also required.

## Sequential Process
This method mirrors dynamic team workflows, progressing through tasks in a thoughtful and systematic manner. Task execution follows the predefined order in the task list, with the output of one task serving as context for the next.

To customize task context, utilize the `context` parameter in the `Task` class to specify outputs that should be used as context for subsequent tasks.

## Hierarchical Process
Emulates a corporate hierarchy, CrewAI allows specifying a custom manager agent or automatically creates one, requiring the specification of a manager language model (`manager_llm`). This agent oversees task execution, including planning, delegation, and validation. Tasks are not pre-assigned; the manager allocates tasks to agents based on their capabilities, reviews outputs, and assesses task completion.

## Process Class: Detailed Overview
The `Process` class is implemented as an enumeration (`Enum`), ensuring type safety and restricting process values to the defined types (`sequential`, `hierarchical`). The consensual process is planned for future inclusion, emphasizing our commitment to continuous development and innovation.

## Conclusion
The structured collaboration facilitated by processes within CrewAI is crucial for enabling systematic teamwork among agents. This documentation has been updated to reflect the latest features, enhancements, and the planned integration of the Consensual Process, ensuring users have access to the most current and comprehensive information.

## Overview of a Task

!!! note "What is a Task?"
In the crewAI framework, tasks are specific assignments completed by agents. They provide all necessary details for execution, such as a description, the agent responsible, required tools, and more, facilitating a wide range of action complexities.

Tasks within crewAI can be collaborative, requiring multiple agents to work together. This is managed through the task properties and orchestrated by the Crew's process, enhancing teamwork and efficiency.

## Creating a Task

Creating a task involves defining its scope, responsible agent, and any additional attributes for flexibility:

```python
from crewai import Task

task = Task(
    description='Find and summarize the latest and most relevant news on AI',
    agent=sales_agent,
    expected_output='A bullet list summary of the top 5 most important AI news',
)
```

!!! note "Task Assignment"
Directly specify an `agent` for assignment or let the `hierarchical` CrewAI's process decide based on roles, availability, etc.

## Task Output

!!! note "Understanding Task Outputs"
The output of a task in the crewAI framework is encapsulated within the `TaskOutput` class. This class provides a structured way to access results of a task, including various formats such as raw output, JSON, and Pydantic models.
By default, the `TaskOutput` will only include the `raw` output. A `TaskOutput` will only include the `pydantic` or `json_dict` output if the original `Task` object was configured with `output_pydantic` or `output_json`, respectively.

### Task Output Attributes

| Attribute         | Parameters      | Type                       | Description                                                                                        |
| :---------------- | :-------------- | :------------------------- | :------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Description**   | `description`   | `str`                      | Description of the task.                                                                           |
| **Summary**       | `summary`       | `Optional[str]`            | Summary of the task, auto-generated from the first 10 words of the description.                    |
| **Raw**           | `raw`           | `str`                      | The raw output of the task. This is the default format for the output.                             |
| **Pydantic**      | `pydantic`      | `Optional[BaseModel]`      | A Pydantic model object representing the structured output of the task.                            |
| **JSON Dict**     | `json_dict`     | `Optional[Dict[str, Any]]` | A dictionary representing the JSON output of the task.                                             |
| **Agent**         | `agent`         | `str`                      | The agent that executed the task.                                                                  |
| **Output Format** | `output_format` | `OutputFormat`             | The format of the task output, with options including RAW, JSON, and Pydantic. The default is RAW. |

### Task Methods and Properties

| Method/Property | Description                                                                                       |
| :-------------- | :------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **json**        | Returns the JSON string representation of the task output if the output format is JSON.           |
| **to_dict**     | Converts the JSON and Pydantic outputs to a dictionary.                                           |
| **str**         | Returns the string representation of the task output, prioritizing Pydantic, then JSON, then raw. |

### Accessing Task Outputs

Once a task has been executed, its output can be accessed through the `output` attribute of the `Task` object. The `TaskOutput` class provides various ways to interact with and present this output.

#### Example

```python
# Example task
task = Task(
    description='Find and summarize the latest AI news',
    expected_output='A bullet list summary of the top 5 most important AI news',
    agent=research_agent,
    tools=[search_tool]
)

# Execute the crew
crew = Crew(
    agents=[research_agent],
    tasks=[task],
    verbose=True
)

result = crew.kickoff()

# Accessing the task output
task_output = task.output

print(f"Task Description: {task_output.description}")
print(f"Task Summary: {task_output.summary}")
print(f"Raw Output: {task_output.raw}")
if task_output.json_dict:
    print(f"JSON Output: {json.dumps(task_output.json_dict, indent=2)}")
if task_output.pydantic:
    print(f"Pydantic Output: {task_output.pydantic}")
```

## Integrating Tools with Tasks

Leverage tools from the [crewAI Toolkit](https://github.com/joaomdmoura/crewai-tools) and [LangChain Tools](https://python.langchain.com/docs/integrations/tools) for enhanced task performance and agent interaction.

## Creating a Task with Tools

```python
import os
os.environ["OPENAI_API_KEY"] = "Your Key"
os.environ["SERPER_API_KEY"] = "Your Key" # serper.dev API key

from crewai import Agent, Task, Crew
from crewai_tools import SerperDevTool

research_agent = Agent(
  role='Researcher',
  goal='Find and summarize the latest AI news',
  backstory="""You're a researcher at a large company.
  You're responsible for analyzing data and providing insights
  to the business.""",
  verbose=True
)

# to perform a semantic search for a specified query from a text's content across the internet
search_tool = SerperDevTool()

task = Task(
  description='Find and summarize the latest AI news',
  expected_output='A bullet list summary of the top 5 most important AI news',
  agent=research_agent,
  tools=[search_tool]
)

crew = Crew(
    agents=[research_agent],
    tasks=[task],
    verbose=True
)

result = crew.kickoff()
print(result)
```

This demonstrates how tasks with specific tools can override an agent's default set for tailored task execution.

## Referring to Other Tasks

In crewAI, the output of one task is automatically relayed into the next one, but you can specifically define what tasks' output, including multiple, should be used as context for another task.

This is useful when you have a task that depends on the output of another task that is not performed immediately after it. This is done through the `context` attribute of the task:

```python
# ...

research_ai_task = Task(
    description='Find and summarize the latest AI news',
    expected_output='A bullet list summary of the top 5 most important AI news',
    async_execution=True,
    agent=research_agent,
    tools=[search_tool]
)

research_ops_task = Task(
    description='Find and summarize the latest AI Ops news',
    expected_output='A bullet list summary of the top 5 most important AI Ops news',
    async_execution=True,
    agent=research_agent,
    tools=[search_tool]
)

write_blog_task = Task(
    description="Write a full blog post about the importance of AI and its latest news",
    expected_output='Full blog post that is 4 paragraphs long',
    agent=writer_agent,
    context=[research_ai_task, research_ops_task]
)

#...
```

## Asynchronous Execution

You can define a task to be executed asynchronously. This means that the crew will not wait for it to be completed to continue with the next task. This is useful for tasks that take a long time to be completed, or that are not crucial for the next tasks to be performed.

You can then use the `context` attribute to define in a future task that it should wait for the output of the asynchronous task to be completed.

```python
#...

list_ideas = Task(
    description="List of 5 interesting ideas to explore for an article about AI.",
    expected_output="Bullet point list of 5 ideas for an article.",
    agent=researcher,
    async_execution=True # Will be executed asynchronously
)

list_important_history = Task(
    description="Research the history of AI and give me the 5 most important events.",
    expected_output="Bullet point list of 5 important events.",
    agent=researcher,
    async_execution=True # Will be executed asynchronously
)

write_article = Task(
    description="Write an article about AI, its history, and interesting ideas.",
    expected_output="A 4 paragraph article about AI.",
    agent=writer,
    context=[list_ideas, list_important_history] # Will wait for the output of the two tasks to be completed
)

#...
```

## Callback Mechanism

The callback function is executed after the task is completed, allowing for actions or notifications to be triggered based on the task's outcome.

```python
# ...

def callback_function(output: TaskOutput):
    # Do something after the task is completed
    # Example: Send an email to the manager
    print(f"""
        Task completed!
        Task: {output.description}
        Output: {output.raw}
    """)

research_task = Task(
    description='Find and summarize the latest AI news',
    expected_output='A bullet list summary of the top 5 most important AI news',
    agent=research_agent,
    tools=[search_tool],
    callback=callback_function
)

#...
```

## Accessing a Specific Task Output

Once a crew finishes running, you can access the output of a specific task by using the `output` attribute of the task object:

```python
# ...
task1 = Task(
    description='Find and summarize the latest AI news',
    expected_output='A bullet list summary of the top 5 most important AI news',
    agent=research_agent,
    tools=[search_tool]
)

#...

crew = Crew(
    agents=[research_agent],
    tasks=[task1, task2, task3],
    verbose=True
)

result = crew.kickoff()

# Returns a TaskOutput object with the description and results of the task
print(f"""
    Task completed!
    Task: {task1.output.description}
    Output: {task1.output.raw}
""")
```

## Tool Override Mechanism

Specifying tools in a task allows for dynamic adaptation of agent capabilities, emphasizing CrewAI's flexibility.

## Error Handling and Validation Mechanisms

While creating and executing tasks, certain validation mechanisms are in place to ensure the robustness and reliability of task attributes. These include but are not limited to:

- Ensuring only one output type is set per task to maintain clear output expectations.
- Preventing the manual assignment of the `id` attribute to uphold the integrity of the unique identifier system.

These validations help in maintaining the consistency and reliability of task executions within the crewAI framework.

## Creating Directories when Saving Files

You can now specify if a task should create directories when saving its output to a file. This is particularly useful for organizing outputs and ensuring that file paths are correctly structured.

```python
# ...

save_output_task = Task(
    description='Save the summarized AI news to a file',
    expected_output='File saved successfully',
    agent=research_agent,
    tools=[file_save_tool],
    output_file='outputs/ai_news_summary.txt',
    create_directory=True
)

#...
```

## Conclusion

Tasks are the driving force behind the actions of agents in crewAI. By properly defining tasks and their outcomes, you set the stage for your AI agents to work effectively, either independently or as a collaborative unit. Equipping tasks with appropriate tools, understanding the execution process, and following robust validation practices are crucial for maximizing CrewAI's potential, ensuring agents are effectively prepared for their assignments and that tasks are executed as intended.

## Creating your own Tools

!!! example "Custom Tool Creation"
    Developers can craft custom tools tailored for their agent’s needs or utilize pre-built options:

To create your own crewAI tools you will need to install our extra tools package:

```bash
pip install 'crewai[tools]'
```

Once you do that there are two main ways for one to create a crewAI tool:

### Subclassing `BaseTool`

```python
from crewai_tools import BaseTool

class MyCustomTool(BaseTool):
    name: str = "Name of my tool"
    description: str = "Clear description for what this tool is useful for, your agent will need this information to use it."

    def _run(self, argument: str) -> str:
        # Implementation goes here
        return "Result from custom tool"
```

### Utilizing the `tool` Decorator

```python
from crewai_tools import tool
@tool("Name of my tool")
def my_tool(question: str) -> str:
    """Clear description for what this tool is useful for, your agent will need this information to use it."""
    # Function logic here
    return "Result from your custom tool"
```

### Custom Caching Mechanism
!!! note "Caching"
    Tools can optionally implement a `cache_function` to fine-tune caching behavior. This function determines when to cache results based on specific conditions, offering granular control over caching logic.

```python
from crewai_tools import tool

@tool
def multiplication_tool(first_number: int, second_number: int) -> str:
    """Useful for when you need to multiply two numbers together."""
    return first_number * second_number

def cache_func(args, result):
    # In this case, we only cache the result if it's a multiple of 2
    cache = result % 2 == 0
    return cache

multiplication_tool.cache_function = cache_func

## Conclusion
Tools are pivotal in extending the capabilities of CrewAI agents, enabling them to undertake a broad spectrum of tasks and collaborate effectively. When building solutions with CrewAI, leverage both custom and existing tools to empower your agents and enhance the AI ecosystem. Consider utilizing error handling, caching mechanisms, and the flexibility of tool arguments to optimize your agents' performance and capabilities.

    "# How to Review Tool Calls\n",
    "\n",
    "Human-in-the-loop (HIL) interactions are crucial for [agentic systems](https://langchain-ai.github.io/langgraph/concepts/agentic_concepts/#human-in-the-loop). A common pattern is to add some human in the loop step after certain tool calls. These tool calls often lead to either a function call or saving of some information. Examples include:\n",
    "\n",
    "- A tool call to execute SQL, which will then be run by the tool\n",
    "- A tool call to generate a summary, which will then be saved to the State of the graph\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that using tool calls is common **whether actually calling tools or not**.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are typically a few different interactions you may want to do here:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Approve the tool call and continue\n",
    "2. Modify the tool call manually and then continue\n",
    "3. Give natural language feedback, and then pass that back to the agent instead of continuing\n",
    "\n",
    "We can implement this in LangGraph using a [breakpoint](https://langchain-ai.github.io/langgraph/how-tos/human_in_the_loop/breakpoints/): breakpoints allow us to interrupt graph execution before a specific step. At this breakpoint, we can manually update the graph state taking one of the three options above"
