## Notes for Aider

- Task 1 (project setup) will be provided by the user
- For file system operations, use Python's built-in `os` and `shutil` modules
- To generate diffs, consider using the `difflib` module from Python's standard library
- When working with markdown files, you may want to use a library like `markdown` or `commonmark`
- Use a mocking library like `unittest.mock` or `pytest-mock` for creating test doubles
- Consider using a test runner like `pytest` for easier test organization and execution
- For the terminal interface, you can use Python's built-in `input()` function or a library like `prompt_toolkit` for more advanced features
- The ObsidianBoy class will be responsible for orchestrating all components using LangGraph. Implement the workflow as a series of steps that can be easily modified and extended
- Ensure proper error handling and API rate limiting when interacting with the Anthropic API
- For the AI review feedback loop, use LangGraph to create a multi-step review process that can iterate on content improvements
- When implementing the WebScraper, consider using libraries like `requests` for HTTP requests and `beautifulsoup4` for HTML parsing
- The KnowledgeBase abstraction allows for easy swapping of storage mechanisms in the future. Consider implementing a simple file-based storage first, with the option to extend to more complex systems later
- When implementing the MemoryManager, focus on preparing the context in a format that's easy for the LLM to process
- In the Researcher, ensure that the entry title is used as a prefix when storing content in the KnowledgeBase to avoid naming conflicts
