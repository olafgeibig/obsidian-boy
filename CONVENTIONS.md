# Coding
- Use Python 3.12 features and syntax.
- Follow PEP 8 style guide for Python code.
- Use type hints everywhere possible
- Use list, dict, and set comprehensions when appropriate for concise and readable code.
- Prefer pathlib over os.path for file system operations.
- Use explicit exception handling. Catch specific exceptions rather than using bare except clauses.
- Keep functions and methods small and focused on a single task.
- Use docstrings for all public modules, functions, classes, and methods.
- Use dataclasses for data containers when appropriate.
- Prefer composition over inheritance where possible.
- Use logging for debugging and monitoring.
- Use meaningful variable and method names.

# Testing
- Use pytest as the testing framework.
- Aim for 100% test coverage for all new code.
- Write unit tests for all public methods and functions.
- Use parametrized tests to cover multiple scenarios
- Use mocking to isolate units of code in testing
- Use fixtures for setting up test environments and data.
- Keep tests independent and idempotent.
- Use meaningful names for test functions that describe the scenario being tested.
- Include both positive and negative test cases.
